# Willoughby’s Beach

“Just because I like you, it doesn’t mean I like you.” This contradictory phrase carries throughout the distorted two-chord title track of *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)* which ends the EP with a bang. In an interview for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203061920/http://messandnoise.com/citizenship/4372941), Eric revealed the inspiration for the song’s title. “Willoughby’s Beach is [a] small patch of sand by [the] banks of the Edward River in Deniliquin [Victoria].” This beach can be found at the [Deniliquin Campgrounds](https://www.visitthemurray.com.au/products/willoughbys-beach-campground). The song would be the [b-side](https://kglw.net/discography/black-toothwilloughbys-beach-single) of [“Black Tooth”](https://kglw.net/song/black-tooth) and was released on *Willoughby’s Beach* on October 21st, 2011.

The first confirmed performance of the song was on [2011-10-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-17-2011-pbs-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at PBS Studios in Naarm (Melbourne), and it would be played at least three other times in the year. It would also be played throughout 2012 with a performance from [2012-05-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-9-2012-kings-cross-hotel-potts-point-nsw-australia.html) being released as a [live video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrI7hfBIrdg) edited by The Brianstorm Project. From 2013 to 2015, only a few performances are known to exist. Following a performance at Glastonbury on [2015-06-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-27-2015-the-park-glastonbury-united-kingdom.html), which would appear in *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=1484s)*, the song would see a five year gap with a return on [2020-02-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-21-2020-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). It has made rare appearances since, surfacing for events such as “Garage Rock Night” on [2021-12-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-22-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html), and the band’s appearance at the Play On the Plains Festival on [2024-03-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-9-2024-deniliquin-festival-site-deniliquin-nsw-australia.html), only a short drive away from the beach itself.
