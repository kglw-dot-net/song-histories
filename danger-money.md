# Danger $$$

Opening up the first “canonical” Gizzard release is “Danger $$$” (pronounced Danger Money): a short and chaotic punk track with a few heavy time changes, a bunch of feedback, distorted harmonica, and simple lyrics that the band join together to sing. Sitting at a minute and forty-five seconds, it’s one of the shortest songs on *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)*, while also being one of its most explosive.

A demo for the song was released on *[Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2)*. Consisting of drum machine, guitar, and vocals, this version is missing the scratchy guitar intro, and the harmonica solo (which is instead a guitar solo). This rendition is ten seconds shorter than the studio version. “Danger $$$” was released on October 21st, 2011.

The song received a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmd7Ons20Bc) on November 20th, 2011. It shows King Gizzard performing at The Tote Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne), footage from Careful Stranger(s) Productions. While it shows the band playing live, the audio is the studio version. In 2018, the song was used in [promotional material](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnm2NF0nS_F/) for the reissue of *Willoughby’s Beach*.
