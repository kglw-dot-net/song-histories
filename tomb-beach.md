# Tomb/Beach

A mid-tempo rock song with reverb-doused instrumentation and grand choruses, “Tomb/Beach” is a two-part closer to King Gizzard’s first EP *[Anglesea](https://kglw.net/discography/anglesea)*. Verse one centers on a metaphorical tomb, while the second has Stu singing about how someone looks “fine like a beach.”

“Tomb/Beach” was [first released](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=198777783471876&id=168329496513295&rdid=tWqzh2bBEXrGF5et) on February 5th, 2011 to their Soundcloud page. It was later included on *Anglesea* which was released as a [limited run of CDs]("https://www.discogs.com/release/4050315-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Anglesea/image/SW1hZ2U6Nzk0MTgwOA==), but was never considered a ‘real’ release by the band. The song was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396587) before the release of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* but wasn’t made widely available. In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu said that *Anglesea* and the other early singles were released on CD for friends and that he didn’t know what happened to them, while [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) stated there were no plans to release the songs anytime soon. After a number of requests during a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6r4lt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), the band released *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)* on Christmas Day. “Tomb/Beach” was the eighth track.

The song was reportedly played on [2010-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2010-unknown-venue-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). No other performances are known.
