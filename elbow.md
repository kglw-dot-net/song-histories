# Elbow

Starting King Gizzard’s [debut album](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise) with a bang, “Elbow” is a noisy, confrontational, but simple song that gets your blood flowing. It's a song about someone who sees themselves as a “big shot,” though they know that their provocations are only going to lead to pain. The lyrics are vague, but no doubt bitter. The band plays through heavy distortion on the song and chants “hey” throughout the choruses, giving the entire track a Ramones-like punk rock feel. That’s not to say, however, that “Elbow” is devoid of Gizzard’s flair, as the delayed guitars and unusual production choices set them well on their way toward a signature sound.

In a track-by-track rundown for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295), Stu said the song was “one of the oldest tracks on the album. We played it for the first time at Meredith last year, but I think it was pretty different back then. I can’t really remember. It has a huge flange on the end of the track, which is funny.” According to a recording of [2011-12-31](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-31-2011-the-esplanade-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), pre-*12 Bar Bruise* versions of the song feature different lyrics following “you are such a big shot.” It received a [single release](https://kglw.net/discography/elbow-single) on July 25th, 2012 on the [band’s Soundcloud page](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/photos/pb.100044289166773.-2207520000/477754042237504/?type=3) (the link is no longer working). It was released on *12 Bar Bruise* on September 7th, 2012 and was later used in [promotional material](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnYTOjzHhw9/) for the 2018 reissues of the band’s early material.

The song was debuted on [2011-12-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-9-2011-meredith-supernatural-amphitheatre-meredith-vic-australia.html) at the Meredith Music Festival and was played a number of times up to late 2013. After a performance on [2013-08-29](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-29-2013-northcote-social-club-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) it vanished from setlists. It would only be played a few more times in 2018, with one performance from [2018-10-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-4-2018-escena-monterrey-mexico.html) making it into the video *[KING GIZZ vs KEMONITO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw0yFGmB-AE)*. “Elbow” has not been seen since late 2018, though Cavs played the song briefly during his [drum seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9O9b-U0nl4&t=1381s) at Drumtek in Northcote in 2022.
