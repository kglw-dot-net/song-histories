According to the [liner notes](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/bootlegger) of *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)*, we know that the song was recorded in Carlton at some point in 2011. “Trench Foot” was released as a single through the band’s Soundcloud page on April 19th, 2011. A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0jiwrygZo) for the track was released on Eric’s YouTube channel (now Gizzard’s) that same day. It’s made up of a clip from episode two of *[V: The Final Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_The_Final_Battle)* where a character named Robin gives birth to twins, one with a serpent tongue and the other a humanoid lizard. This is the oldest surviving King Gizzard music video as an earlier video for [“Eddie Cousin”](https://kglw.net/song/eddie-cousin) is unavailable. While it was an official release by the band, it was never given a physical release until its inclusion on the compilation *[New Center Of The Universe Vol. #1](https://kglw.net/discography/new-centre-of-the-universe-vol1)* in 2012. In the years following, the song was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396588) but was never officially released by the band under Flightless, with Stu saying in a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that he had no intention of releasing it officially. After numerous requests in a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6r4lt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), the band released *Teenage Gizzard* on Christmas Day, 2020. “Trench Foot” was included as the ninth song.

The only known performance of “Trench Foot” was on [2011-04-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-25-2011-rmit-tv-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at RMIT TV Studios for the show *The Temperature's Rising*. A clip of their performance would be uploaded by Eric to his YouTube page with the title *[King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard try and play on TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C82ht2WZ7Zw)*. It shows the band starting the song but having to start again because Eric’s cymbal falls over.
