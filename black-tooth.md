# Black Tooth

The band [described](https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-hit-the-road/) “Black Tooth” as “two minutes and thirty seconds of music to rob banks to.” Hearing it in all of its garage rock glory, it’s hard to disagree. Talking about the narrator’s sleep and dental issues, “Black Tooth” comes out of the gate fast before settling on an infectious, danceable groove. Despite being a rarity in the modern day, the song was the band’s first real introduction to the public and their first taste of success.

Before a performance on [2022-10-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-2-2022-william-randolph-hearst-greek-theatre-berkeley-ca-usa.html), Ambrose said Stu came up with the riff and introduced it to the band at the studio. “I still remember the day coming into the studio, walking in and Stu was wearing a blue singlet and he stunk of goon — goon is like a wine sack in Australia. He had all, like food stains on him, he’s like ‘got this riff! Goes really fast and then it slows down!’” “Black Tooth” was released as the [first single](https://kglw.net/discography/black-toothwilloughbys-beach-single) for *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)* on [June 7th 2011](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=109431135813713&id=168329496513295&rdid=CCw9ibrZAyQHGX40). This single was a breakthrough moment for the band.  

Triple J DJ Dom Alessio would [call the band](https://web.archive.org/web/20111224015942/http://www.sonicbids.com/epk/epk.aspx?epk_id=317399) “a tour de force of reverberated rock’n’roll” following its release, and the song would [see rotation](https://www.pressreader.com/australia/deniliquin-pastoral-times/20120203/282157878143404) on Australian community/public radio. Their 2011 tour would even be dubbed the [“Black Tooth tour”](https://archive.org/details/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-2011-posters/Capture%200.1.jpg). The song was released on *Willoughby’s Beach* on October 21st, 2011. In the following year it made an [appearance](https://youtu.be/-TSyRGzONMo?si=mR_9DWBneqBMeuDy) on the TV show *[Private Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Practice_(TV_series))* during the season five episode “Drifting Back.” It would also be used in a [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8pJ4zG0-J8) for the band’s 2018 vinyl reissues.

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokGGBuKpyw) for the song was released on Eric’s YouTube Channel (now King Gizzard’s) on June 8th, 2011 and shows two elephants with filters mirroring the footage, reversing it occasionally and shifting the color balance. It’s unclear who made the video as they were never credited in the comments or the video’s description though it was most likely Eric considering that his channel was used.

The song would be in heavy rotation for 2012 and remained with the band for occasional performances going forward into 2013-2015. After a performance on [2015-09-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-13-2015-johnny-brendas-philadelphia-pa-usa.html) at Johnny Brenda’s in Philadelphia, the song would take a long break before reappearing at the Princess Theatre on [2021-12-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-22-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html) for “Garage Rock Night.” Following this, the song was played twice in 2022: on [2022-04-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-18-2022-event-lawn-at-virgin-hotels-las-vegas-las-vegas-nv-usa.html) in Las Vegas and on [2022-10-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-2-2022-william-randolph-hearst-greek-theatre-berkeley-ca-usa.html) in Berkeley.
