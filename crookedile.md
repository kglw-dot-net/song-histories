# Crookedile

“Crookedile” is a rowdy garage rock song based around one lyric: “just say God is on your side.” This makes “Crookedile” the first released Gizzard song to bring up any sort of religious or spiritual aspect, which is revisited later on songs like: [“God Is Calling Me Back Home,”](https://kglw.net/song/god-is-calling-me-back-home) [“God Is In The Rhythm”](https://kglw.net/song/god-is-in-the-rhythm) and [“Supreme Ascendancy.”](https://kglw.net/song/supreme-ascendancy) It’s also the first time the band has ever done anything related to crocodilians, which would end up being an iconic aspect of the band’s imagery — such as the gator seen in the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUZn1I6llJs&t=22s) for [“The River.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-river) “Crookedile” was released on October 21st, 2011 as the fourth song on *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)*.
