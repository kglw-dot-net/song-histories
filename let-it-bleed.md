# Let It Bleed

Sharing its name with the 1969 Rolling Stones [album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_It_Bleed) and [song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_It_Bleed_(song)), “Let It Bleed” is the slowest track on *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)* and utilizes a single repeated lyric: “I want to see my love bird again.” The song contains an unusual mix for the timeframe, with acoustic guitars alongside reverb-drenched electric guitars, vocals, and harmonica.

A demo for the song was released on *[Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2)*. Unlike the final studio version, this version is faster and comes in about thirty seconds shorter. It was recorded by Stu on electric guitar, bass, drum machine, and vocals only. The studio version was released on October 21st, 2011.
