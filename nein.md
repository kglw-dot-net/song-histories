# Nein

“Nein” is a rhythmic, heavy and psychedelic garage rock track featuring high gain guitars, a tight rhythm section, a bunch of chanting vocals, and some theremin for good measure. The song is about drinking and how it makes the song’s narrator feel awful, its lyrics simply count up from one to nine, with the final number being replaced by the German word “nein,” meaning “no.”

During a track-by-track rundown of *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295), Stu said the song came out of a jam session of a song by The Clean. For promotion of the song, a [DIY shirt](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=503265859686322&set=a.503265679686340) was made in September of 2012. "Nein" was released on *12 Bar Bruise* that same month.

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLfhjrUI_uI) for “Nein” by Zonkvision (Jason Galea and Greg Holden) released on November 22nd, 2012 shows the band playing the song with flashing lights and other footage overlaid on top. According to an [interview for Speaker TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIJgqO6MKO4) the video was shot on the same day as the videos for [“Bloody Ripper”](https://kglw.net/song/bloody-ripper?artist_id=1) and [“Muckraker”](https://kglw.net/song/muckraker?artist_id=1) in Anglesea. In that same interview Eric mentions that the video was shot using old VHS cameras.

Based on available setlist data, “Nein” has never been played live.
