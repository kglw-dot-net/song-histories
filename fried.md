The earliest release of the song we know was on January 26th, 2011. The band [posted](https://www.facebook.com/100044289166773/posts/173226506055815/?rdid=FoUCdIcvm5eRH5ms) the song to their SoundCloud page. It was later put onto *Anglesea* which was released as a [limited run of CDs](https://www.discogs.com/release/4050315-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Anglesea/image/SW1hZ2U6Nzk0MTgwOA==), but was never considered a ‘real’ release by the band. While it was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396565) before the release of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)*, the song never saw an official release beyond the original *Anglesea* drop. In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu said that *Anglesea* and the early singles were released on CD for friends and that he didn’t know what happened to them, while [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) stated there were no plans to release the songs anytime soon. After a number of requests during a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6r4lt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), the band released *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)* on Christmas Day. “Fried” was the sixth track.

While there was a reported performance on [2010-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2010-unknown-venue-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), only one performance of the song has been confirmed, that being [2011-02-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-12-2011-geelong-gaol-museum-geelong-vic-australia.html) at the Geelong Gaol in Geelong. This performance of the song is much longer than the studio version, hitting a bit over six minutes in length and featuring an improv-based intro.
