# Guns & Horses

After attacking the two remaining men, Blue takes off with the horses and all of their gear to head to a Yavapai stronghold. He finds comfort in their cries as he knows that the two men are left in the middle of the wilderness alone without food, water or any tools all while dressed as Yavapai-Apaches. A slow, painful fate awaits them. While they die in the wilderness, Blue drinks and eats with the thought of their deaths in his mind.  Blue’s story is left open-ended at the conclusion of “Guns & Horses”, leaving the possibility for a sequel. In 2014 Stu said to [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20141112132955/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4574833) “I want to do a follow-up one day. He [the protagonist] was pretty young at the end of the story so it’s got plenty of time for him to go on (an)other adventure.” Broderick [said to Happy Magazine](https://happymag.tv/eyes-like-the-sky/)  "we did talk about taking the character and bringing him over here [to Australia] for the gold fields or the opium wars in China or something, because at the end of the story he's gone. He could be going anywhere." Ultimately the sequel to *[Eyes Like the Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)* was never recorded by the band, leaving O’Brien’s story at this violent moment.

“Guns & Horses” is the shortest track on Eyes Like The Sky and features acoustic guitar, pounding drums, and a sinister guitar line, as well as the sounds of horses and vibraslap. It was released on February 22nd, 2013.

“Guns & Horses” has never been played live.
