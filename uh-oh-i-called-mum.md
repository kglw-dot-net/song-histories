# Uh Oh, I Called Mum

“Uh Oh, I Called Mum” follows someone who takes a “glob” (most likely cannabis oil) and gets anxious, leading to them calling their mom to calm down. The song is seemingly inspired by The Ramones and early surf rock. It’s fast, loud and no doubt silly.

While on [Mornings With Zan on Triple J](https://web.archive.org/web/20121114091924/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/zan/blog/s3583506.htm), Eric explained that the song was inspired by a real life event. “It came from an experience Lucas had at Golden Plains actually, this year I think, while listening to, was it um… Charles Bradley? Just watching him play, this incredible old soul singer like absolutely so sort of like, heartfelt and this amazing performance and Lucas just kind of started to, you know, get a little bit anxious or a little bit excited and he kind of freaked out a little bit and ended up in the medical tent and he called his mum. Cause that was the only thing that was gonna sort of make him feel better, was calling his mum. Yeah, and that’s kind of how this story evolved and Stu decided to write a little tune about it.” He jokingly adds “We could never sort of, never let him get away with it so I guess we put it in a song so now it’s just out there forever.” Charles Bradley’s performance would have been on [March 11th, 2012](https://consequence.net/2011/12/charles-bradley-schedules-2012-tour-dates/). Exact recording dates for the band are hard to come by, but we know that at least some vocal overdubs were done on May 26th, 2012 as they [uploaded a video of Ambrose screaming the intro](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10150977557907755) to their Facebook page. It was released on *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* on September 7th, 2012.
