The [earliest mention](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/5eiSVqUoEnx4z8Y7/) of the song was on November 16th, 2010 when it was uploaded to the band’s Soundcloud page. A [CD single](https://kglw.net/discography/sleepsummer-single) for “Sleep” and “Summer!” was released sometime that same year with a fold-out sleeve depicting King Gizzard and a Lizard Wizard. It was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396584) before the release of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* in 2013 but wasn’t released digitally. In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu explained that the CDs were made for friends and that he was unsure what happened to them. He [also said](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that, at the time, he had no intentions on re-releasing the singles. Despite not releasing the songs officially, “Summer!” floated around on unofficial bootlegs. At the end of 2017, the lyrics of “Summer!” were adapted for the *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)* song [“Muddy Water.”](https://kglw.net/song/muddy-water) In a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6r4lt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), the band were asked multiple times to release the early material as part of a compilation. On December 14th, they [tweeted](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1338441959728246785?s=46&t=BsPWJiwij5zesoKn4EojGA) that they were looking for high quality FLACs of the first two singles. This would become *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)*, released on Christmas Day, 2020. “Summer!” would be the fourth song on the album.

Based on available data, “Summer!” has not been played live. In March of 2022 before the band’s tour, they [tweeted](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322054312/https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1506144235657269248) out if there were any deep cuts fans wanted to hear. When a fan responded with a request for “Summer!,” they responded “now that’s deep!”
