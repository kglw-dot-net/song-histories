# Eddie Cousin

Fast paced, energetic, and filled with simplistic but fun chants, “Eddie Cousin” opens the band’s first EP *[Anglesea](https://kglw.net/discography/anglesea)* with a blast.

The song is actually important to the band’s history as it’s the song Ambrose heard that made it clear that King Gizzard was onto something. In an [NME article](https://www.nme.com/big-reads/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-cover-interview-2022-changes-3335897), he said this in a conversation alongside Cavs: “I was the last to join the band. When I saw these guys play, I knew it was going to be something… I remember standing there with Jamie Harmer and we were talking about it when you were playing ‘Eddie Cousin’. We were all in these bands at the time and everyone was trying to be like Bob Dylan. Everyone wanted to be this 16-year-old bohemian singer-songwriter, all very mature. Stu just came out of nowhere, playing three chords and everyone was going crazy! It had the energy, the thing everyone was lacking. It’s hard to grasp, unless you’ve seen it in the flesh.” [First released](https://www.facebook.com/share/XowwJgAHErpJo8U3/?mibextid=WC7FNe) on January 11th, 2011, it saw a release on *Anglesea*, the band’s first EP that was never considered a ‘real’ release by the band. While it was put on the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396564), the band never gave it an official digital release. In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu said that *Anglesea* and the early singles were released on CD for friends and that he didn’t know what happened to them, while [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) stated there were no plans to release the songs anytime soon. After a number of requests during a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6r4lt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), the band released *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)* on Christmas Day. “Eddie Cousin” was the fifth track.

While first reported on [2010-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2010-unknown-venue-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), the first confirmed performance of “Eddie Cousin” was on [2011-02-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-12-2011-geelong-gaol-museum-geelong-vic-australia.html) at the Geelong Gaol in Geelong where it served as a closer. This performance was most likely used as the foundation of a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrIOM6-zjHA) for “Eddie Cousin.” Created by The Brianstorm Project, this was the first King Gizzard music video. Despite its historical significance, it is now unavailable, though bits of footage appear in the promotional video *[REISSUES CONFIRMED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8pJ4zG0-J8)*. On [2011-04-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-25-2011-rmit-tv-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) the song would be performed at RMIT TV Studios for the show *The Temperature's Rising*. The final known performance would be on [2011-08-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-19-2011-the-esplanade-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html).
