# High Hopes Low

“High Hopes Low” starts the second side of *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* (released September 7th, 2012) with an iconic electronic drum beat before leading into a rowdy garage rock song with very simplistic lyrics about expectations and intelligence. In a track-by-track rundown of *12 Bar Bruise* for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295), Stu stated that the song is actually composed of two separate takes:  

“Recorded in two separate sessions a month apart. One was kinda hi-fi-ish, with all the instruments panned wide, and the other was really crunchy, with everything dead centre. Really different recordings. We spliced the two recordings up and now the song switches between the two. It sounds cool in headphones.” Some fans have noted the similarities between “High Hopes Low” and the Osees track [“Grease 2”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUByoYj7Lso) released on the 2008 album *[The Master's Bedroom Is Worth Spending a Night In](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master%27s_Bedroom_Is_Worth_Spending_a_Night_In)* We know that King Gizzard took a ton of influence from the band in the early 2010s with [Stu saying to Triple J](https://web.archive.org/web/20111129014623/http://www.triplejunearthed.com/Artists/FeaturedArtist.aspx?artistid=41113) “I don’t think we’ve developed a sound. We’re still just fucking around in the garage. I think we’re just making loud noises and passing it off as music. Basically I just took the best songs from the best Oh Sees records and added a Bo Diddley beat.”

The first confirmed performance of “High Hopes Low” was on [2011-12-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-9-2011-meredith-supernatural-amphitheatre-meredith-vic-australia.html) and it would be played a number of times from 2011 to 2013. The final known performance was on [2013-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-9-2011-meredith-supernatural-amphitheatre-meredith-vic-australia.html) at the Corner Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). Based on available recordings, versions past 2011 feature the song’s intro.
