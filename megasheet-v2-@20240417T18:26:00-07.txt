Editing:
These are intended to be the most in depth resource for anything you might want to know about every King Gizzard song. Each song history will be hosted on its own webpage parsed in HTML and Markdown.


Writing and editing process is tracked in the song history document status spreadsheet. At this stage we are most concerned with the ‘proofread status’ tab. Level 1 is the first pass for content (sections missing?), order structure (anything repeated unnecessarily?), syntax etc.
Level 2 is the finer pass ready for publication on the site, more concerned with spelling, grammar, line/paragraph breaks.
Please always use the ‘suggesting’ (rather than editing directly) feature or highlight and comment for any proposed changes to ensure more than one set of eyes goes over everything.


The structure for each song history is the song history document status spreadsheet:
Intro (with interpretation/interview sources) > debut/earliest history (whatever is first) > studio > live history > boot/demo data if needed.
Though this structure is subject to change depending on available info/relevancy. It has typically only been consistent for each song within an album, ie. all the earliest albums might be lacking in info and therefore their song histories take on a different style to later albums.


Formatting:
Markdown
* Do links with [example text](example link) (example: [“Vegemite”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Inr7FKKWLI) 
* Do italics like *example* or _example_. (ex: *[Demos Vol. 3: Music To Eat Pond Scum To (https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-3)*)
* Do bold like **_____**. Same rule as above for links
* Do not mix the asterisks in with a link as it breaks it. (ex. *[Demos Vol. 3:* Music To Eat Pond Scum To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-3).)


HTML
Link like this: <a href="link address" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">link text</a>
* Do paragraphs with <p> at the start and </p> at the end. (NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MARKDOWN)
* Italicize with <i> and </i>
* Bold with <b> and </b>
* Center embedded YouTube videos with <div style="text-align: center;"> at front of embed. Make sure to use <div style="text-align: left;"> at the end to reorient the text.


Note: Please use markdown for the main text. You can combine HTML and markdown on the song pages but for consistency keep all text in markdown. Embeds can be done in HTML.


General
* Album/film titles in italics, song titles in double quotes. These make it much easier to read.
* Use [ ] instead of ( ) for missing words. (ex. “Yeah, that [was] what we used.”)
* Remove any live album/demo album sections that you find at the end of a write up (mentioning an album is fine, we’re just talking about that final paragraph)
* Fix album/song/project names that are misspelled in a source to fit how it's actually spelled by the band
* Use the correct em dash character “—” (alt+0151) instead of a plain hyphen “-”.
* Use single quotes within double quotes. Makes it less confusing. (ex. Stu said “the best line I ever wrote was ‘I love my vegemite.’ It speaks volumes to me.”)
* Time signatures should not be represented by one character (7/8 rather than ⅞) 
* Link every song, video, interview, etc you can but only do one link per source. For instance, only like to the song page for the first instance of “Gamma Knife” on the page rather than all instances of it. Do not link the page for the song you’re already reading about.
* Always remember to add any additions to the Google Spreadsheet.


Adding to site
* Doc and site must look the exact same. Any changes should be made to the doc first and then to the site. Do not add without any discussion with Timeland/proofreaders.
* If you are not a proofreader, DO NOT PUT ANYTHING ON THE SONG PAGES YOURSELF. Please talk to us if you have any issues with the histories.


Currency:
Upon implementation, this will necessarily become a ‘live’ document requiring updating. Aside from having to add any new releases, the main thing to update in the existing entries will be when a song is debuted live, or a demo released. With less urgency, any new information that comes out via interviews/etc. about older songs could also be added.


Draft Complete
Teenage Gizzard
Hey There
“Hey There” is a fitting opener for King Gizzard’s debut single. Featuring a set of simplistic lyrics about loving someone (and their hair) and a groovy garage rock composition, it kicks off the band’s career with a bang.
In the band’s [first ever Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=169305639752159&id=168329496513295&rdid=35zeaRbj66EC5KAy) on October 19th, 2010, they posted a link to “Hey There” which was hosted on SoundCloud. A CD single for *[Hey There/Ants and Bats](https://kglw.net/discography/hey-thereants)* was released in 2010 with a fold-out sleeve depicting King Gizzard and a Lizard Wizard. Outside of this, the band refused to release the song officially though they had added it to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396569). In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu explained that the CDs were made for friends and that he was unsure what happened to them. He [also said](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that, at the time, he had no intentions on re-releasing the singles. For years the single was circulated unofficially. On December 14th, 2020, the band [tweeted](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1338441959728246785?s=46&t=BsPWJiwij5zesoKn4EojGA) that they were looking for high quality FLACs of the first two singles. This would be for *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)*, released on Christmas Day.
“Hey There” was reportedly played on [2010-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2010-unknown-venue-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). No other performances are known.

Ants and Bats
With a descending chromatic bass line similar to Pink Floyd’s 1973 hit [“Money,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_(Pink_Floyd_song)) explosive choruses and simple, disconnected lyrics, “Ants and Bats” is a powerful b-side for the band’s debut single.

The song was [first mentioned](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/rNzjxt7WPbvSAMLv/) on October 22nd, 2010 with a link to the song on their Facebook page. A CD single for *[Hey There/Ants and Bats](https://kglw.net/discography/hey-thereants)* was released in 2010 with a fold-out sleeve depicting King Gizzard and a Lizard Wizard. Outside of this, the band refused to release the song officially though they had registered it in the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396562). In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu explained that the CDs were made for friends and that he was unsure what happened to them.

“Ants and Bats” earliest known performance was on [2010-10-29](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-29-2010-kaleide-theatre-rmit-university-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Kaleide Theatre at RMIT University. This was only seven days after the song was initially released. The final confirmed performance was on [2011-02-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-12-2011-geelong-gaol-museum-geelong-vic-australia.html)  at the Geelong Gaol in Geelong. Live versions of the song contain a longer intro.
Sleep
Opening the band’s second single, “Sleep” is about waking up next to someone who doesn’t want you to leave. Drenched in muffled, delayed guitars, the song evokes a dreamlike, sleepy feeling. It’s the first song in the band’s discography to mention sleeping, a common topic which would reappear on songs like [“Sleep Drifter,”](https://kglw.net/song/sleep-drifter) [“I’m Sleepin’ In”](https://kglw.net/song/im-sleepin-in) and [“Sleepwalker.”](https://kglw.net/song/sleepwalker) 
[First posted](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/W7n3JmkftJSzSRQE/) on November 25th, 2010, the [single for “Sleep”](https://kglw.net/discography/sleepsummer-single) was released as a CD sometime that same year with a fold-out sleeve depicting King Gizzard and a Lizard Wizard. While it was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396581) sometime before the release of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)*, the band refused to release it. In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu explained that the CDs were made for friends and that he was unsure what happened to them. He [also said](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that, at the time, he had no intentions on re-releasing the singles. In a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6r4lt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the band were asked multiple times to release the early material as part of a compilation. On December 14th, they [tweeted](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1338441959728246785?s=46&t=BsPWJiwij5zesoKn4EojGA) that they were looking for high quality FLACs of the first two singles. This would be for *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)*, released on Christmas Day. The compilation contains “Sleep” as the third song.
No performances of “Sleep” are known to exist.

Summer!
A simple garage rock song containing one verse, “Summer!” is the b-side of [“Sleep,”](https://kglw.net/song/sleep?artist_id=1) released in 2010 as the band’s second single.
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v7xTljY9ExE?si=FxKt5o-suPIsAdrh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">
The [earliest mention](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/5eiSVqUoEnx4z8Y7/) of the song was on November 16th, 2010 when it was uploaded to the band’s Soundcloud page. A [CD single](https://kglw.net/discography/sleepsummer-single) for “Sleep” and “Summer!” was released sometime that same year with a fold-out sleeve depicting King Gizzard and a Lizard Wizard. It was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396584) before the release of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* in 2013 but wasn’t released digitally. In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu explained that the CDs were made for friends and that he was unsure what happened to them. He [also said](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that, at the time, he had no intentions on re-releasing the singles. Despite not releasing the songs officially, “Summer!” floated around on unofficial bootlegs. At the end of 2017, the lyrics of “Summer!” were adapted for the *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)* song [“Muddy Water.”](https://kglw.net/song/muddy-water) In a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6r4lt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), the band were asked multiple times to release the early material as part of a compilation. On December 14th, they [tweeted](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1338441959728246785?s=46&t=BsPWJiwij5zesoKn4EojGA) that they were looking for high quality FLACs of the first two singles. This would become *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)*, released on Christmas Day, 2020. “Summer!” would be the fourth song on the album.

Based on available data, “Summer!” has not been played live. In March of 2022 before the band’s tour, they [tweeted](https://web.archive.org/web/20220322054312/https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1506144235657269248) out if there were any deep cuts fans wanted to hear. When a fan responded with a request for “Summer!,” they responded “now that’s deep!”
Eddie Cousin
Fast paced, energetic, and filled with simplistic but fun chants, “Eddie Cousin” opens the band’s first EP *[Anglesea](https://kglw.net/discography/anglesea)* with a blast.
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fxEq-D_h4GQ?si=8uTo3EvhZRu0eLZ_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">
The song is actually important to the band’s history as it’s the song Ambrose heard that made it clear that King Gizzard was onto something. In an [NME article](https://www.nme.com/big-reads/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-cover-interview-2022-changes-3335897), he said this in a conversation alongside Cavs: “I was the last to join the band. When I saw these guys play, I knew it was going to be something… I remember standing there with Jamie Harmer and we were talking about it when you were playing ‘Eddie Cousin’. We were all in these bands at the time and everyone was trying to be like Bob Dylan. Everyone wanted to be this 16-year-old bohemian singer-songwriter, all very mature. Stu just came out of nowhere, playing three chords and everyone was going crazy! It had the energy, the thing everyone was lacking. It’s hard to grasp, unless you’ve seen it in the flesh.” [First released](https://www.facebook.com/share/XowwJgAHErpJo8U3/?mibextid=WC7FNe) on January 11th, 2011, it saw a release on *Anglesea*, the band’s first EP that was never considered a ‘real’ release by the band. While it was put on the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396564), the band never gave it an official digital release. In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu said that *Anglesea* and the early singles were released on CD for friends and that he didn’t know what happened to them, while [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) stated there were no plans to release the songs anytime soon. After a number of requests during a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6r4lt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), the band released *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)* on Christmas Day. “Eddie Cousin” was the fifth track.

While first reported on [2010-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2010-unknown-venue-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), the first confirmed performance of “Eddie Cousin” was on [2011-02-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-12-2011-geelong-gaol-museum-geelong-vic-australia.html) at the Geelong Gaol in Geelong where it served as a closer. This performance was most likely used as the foundation of a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrIOM6-zjHA) for “Eddie Cousin.” Created by The Brianstorm Project, this was the first King Gizzard music video. Despite its historical significance, it is now unavailable, though bits of footage appear in the promotional video *[REISSUES CONFIRMED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8pJ4zG0-J8)*. On [2011-04-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-25-2011-rmit-tv-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) the song would be performed at RMIT TV Studios for the show *The Temperature's Rising*.

This performance of the song is much longer than the studio version, hitting a bit over six minutes in length and featuring an improv-based intro.
Good To Me
The third song on *[Anglesea](https://kglw.net/discography/anglesea)*, “Good To Me”is an upbeat garage rock song with only two lyrics repeated throughout.

The first confirmed performance was on [2011-02-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-12-2011-geelong-gaol-museum-geelong-vic-australia.html) at the Geelong Gaol in Geelong, while the other happened on [2011-03-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-4-2011-the-grace-darling-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at the National Hotel in Geelong for *Anglesea* release party. Live versions of the song feature an extended intro with Stu singing the lyrics syncopated with his guitar, the band joining him to embellish the final notes. He also sings the verses in a crazier way, bringing different inflections than heard on the *Anglesea* version.
Tomb/Beach
A mid-tempo rock song with reverb-doused instrumentation and grand choruses, “Tomb/Beach” is a two-part closer to King Gizzard’s first EP *[Anglesea](https://kglw.net/discography/anglesea)*. Verse one centers on a metaphorical tomb, while the second has Stu singing about how someone looks “fine like a beach.”
“Tomb/Beach” was [first released](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=198777783471876&id=168329496513295&rdid=tWqzh2bBEXrGF5et) on February 5th, 2011 to their Soundcloud page. It was later included on *Anglesea* which was released as a [limited run of CDs]("https://www.discogs.com/release/4050315-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Anglesea/image/SW1hZ2U6Nzk0MTgwOA==), but was never considered a ‘real’ release by the band. The song was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396587) before the release of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* but wasn’t made widely available. In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu said that *Anglesea* and the other early singles were released on CD for friends and that he didn’t know what happened to them, while [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) stated there were no plans to release the songs anytime soon. After a number of requests during a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6r4lt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), the band released *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)* on Christmas Day. “Tomb/Beach” was the eighth track.
The song was reportedly played on [2010-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2010-unknown-venue-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). No other performances are known.

Trench Foot
“Trench Foot” is a short rock tune with a distinct chromatic riff. The title refers to an [injury](https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/trenchfoot.html) caused by long exposure to damp, cold environments which can lead to sores and infections.

According to the [liner notes](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/bootlegger) of *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)*, we know that the song was recorded in Carlton at some point in 2011. “Trench Foot” was released as a single through the band’s Soundcloud page on April 19th, 2011. A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW0jiwrygZo) for the track was released on Eric’s YouTube channel (now Gizzard’s) that same day. It’s made up of a clip from episode two of *[V: The Final Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_The_Final_Battle)* where a character named Robin gives birth to twins, one with a serpent tongue and the other a humanoid lizard. This is the oldest surviving King Gizzard music video as an earlier video for [“Eddie Cousin”](https://kglw.net/song/eddie-cousin) is unavailable. While it was an official release by the band, it was never given a physical release until its inclusion on the compilation *[New Center Of The Universe Vol. #1](https://kglw.net/discography/new-centre-of-the-universe-vol1)* in 2012. In the years following, the song was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396588) but was never officially released by the band under Flightless, with Stu saying in a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that he had no intention of releasing it officially. After numerous requests in a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6r4lt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), the band released *Teenage Gizzard* on Christmas Day, 2020. “Trench Foot” was included as the ninth song.

The only known performance of “Trench Foot” was on [2011-04-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-25-2011-rmit-tv-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at RMIT TV Studios for the show *The Temperature's Rising*. A clip of their performance would be uploaded by Eric to his YouTube page with the title *[King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard try and play on TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C82ht2WZ7Zw)*. It shows the band starting the song but having to start again because Eric’s cymbal falls over.
Life Is Cool
**This song contains subject matter that may not be suitable for all readers as it deals with the topic of self harm/suicide.**


King Gizzard releases a ton of songs, and with that volume of output comes many that will be neglected. Some may see a few appearances then fade away [“The Hungry Wolf of Fate”](https://kglw.net/song/the-hungry-wolf-of-fate), while others may never see time on stage to begin with [“Superposition”](https://kglw.net/song/superposition). Then you have the real oddities: covers of songs like [“Open My Eyes”](https://kglw.net/song/open-my-eyes) and material left as b-sides such as [“The Wholly Ghost”](https://kglw.net/song/the-wholly-ghost). A tier under this, however, are songs that for some reason have nothing to their name. Maybe a performance or two has been documented but as far as release history goes, they’re lost media. One of those songs was “Life Is Cool,” a fuzzy garage rock tune with a catchy riff and some gruesome lyrics. For years the track was lost, though it remained within the band’s circle with occasional mentions. It finally reappeared during the COVID-19 pandemic as the closer to the band’s official bootlegger compilation, *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)*, ending a ten year period of silence.
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MsVIVFLqrfY?si=zMMKWAEe5bYmIkca&amp;start=193" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">
The story of “Life Is Cool” begins in 2010. A performance from [2010-10-29](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-29-2010-kaleide-theatre-rmit-university-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Kaleide Theatre at RMIT University features the band playing the song with a slow groove. A month later on [2010-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2010-unknown-venue-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) the song was reportedly played again. [At some point in 2011](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/bootlegger) the studio version was recorded somewhere in Carlton at a faster pace than the previous renditions. This was [placed on a hard drive](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/teenage-gizzard) then never heard again. “Life Is Cool” was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396574) before the release of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* in 2013 and was referenced in a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/fjdc1tbxBbrAMFaZ/) on October 29th, 2013. In September of 2014, the band created [LIFE IS COOL PTY LTD](https://abr.business.gov.au/ABN/View?abn=28602041663), a private limited company which the band controls to this day. The song was finally included as part of the compilation *Teenage Gizzard* which was released on Christmas Day, 2020.
The main vocal melody is very similar to the highly recognizable melody from the 2010 hit [“Chelsea Dagger”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Dagger) by The Fratellis. At the time, the band’s songwriting technique was [based heavily in mimicry](https://web.archive.org/web/20111129014623/http://www.triplejunearthed.com/Artists/FeaturedArtist.aspx?artistid=41113): “Just waiting for the new Oh Sees record to come out so we can try and write some more songs.” This one was a prime candidate for their house party vibe at the time.

Willoughby’s Beach
Danger $$$
Opening up the first “canonical” Gizzard release is “Danger $$$” (pronounced Danger Money): a short and chaotic punk track with a few heavy time changes, a bunch of feedback, distorted harmonica, and simple lyrics that the band join together to sing. Sitting at a minute and forty-five seconds, it’s one of the shortest songs on *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)*, while also being one of its most explosive.


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CGx-TkpeAP8?si=WSMctrIkiHiU-B1j" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


A demo for the song was released on *[Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2)*. Consisting of drum machine, guitar, and vocals, this version is missing the scratchy guitar intro, and the harmonica solo (which is instead a guitar solo). This rendition is ten seconds shorter than the studio version. “Danger $$$” was released on October 21st, 2011.

The song received a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmd7Ons20Bc) on November 20th, 2011. It shows King Gizzard performing at The Tote Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne), footage from Careful Stranger(s) Productions. While it shows the band playing live, the audio is the studio version. In 2018, the song was used in [promotional material](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnm2NF0nS_F/) for the reissue of *Willoughby’s Beach*.

“Danger $$$”s first known performance was on [2011-10-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-17-2011-pbs-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at PBS Studios in Naarm (Melbourne) during a full performance of *Willoughby’s Beach*. The song would be played at least a few other times that year, with only one known performance in 2012 on [2012-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2012-acdc-lane-naarm-melbourne-australia.html). While many *Willoughby’s* songs would be left off setlists at this point, “Danger $$$” continued to be played all the way into 2016. After a performance on [2016-05-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-14-2016-babys-all-right-brooklyn-ny-usa-2.html) at Baby’s All Right in Brooklyn, the song was played considerably less, with only a few rare performances such as for “Garage Rock Night” on [2021-12-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-22-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html) or at Festival Estéreo Picnic on [2024-03-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-21-2024-parque-simon-bolivar-bogota-colombia.html).

Black Tooth
The band [described](https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-hit-the-road/) “Black Tooth” as “two minutes and thirty seconds of music to rob banks to.” Hearing it in all of its garage rock glory, it’s hard to disagree. Talking about the narrator’s sleep and dental issues, “Black Tooth” comes out of the gate fast before settling on an infectious, danceable groove. Despite being a rarity in the modern day, the song was the band’s first real introduction to the public and their first taste of success.

Before a performance on [2022-10-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-2-2022-william-randolph-hearst-greek-theatre-berkeley-ca-usa.html), Ambrose said Stu came up with the riff and introduced it to the band at the studio. “I still remember the day coming into the studio, walking in and Stu was wearing a blue singlet and he stunk of goon — goon is like a wine sack in Australia. He had all, like food stains on him, he’s like ‘got this riff! Goes really fast and then it slows down!’” “Black Tooth” was released as the [first single](https://kglw.net/discography/black-toothwilloughbys-beach-single) for *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)* on [June 7th 2011](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=109431135813713&id=168329496513295&rdid=CCw9ibrZAyQHGX40). This single was a breakthrough moment for the band.  
Triple J DJ Dom Alessio would [call the band](https://web.archive.org/web/20111224015942/http://www.sonicbids.com/epk/epk.aspx?epk_id=317399) “a tour de force of reverberated rock’n’roll” following its release, and the song would [see rotation](https://www.pressreader.com/australia/deniliquin-pastoral-times/20120203/282157878143404) on Australian community/public radio. Their 2011 tour would even be dubbed the [“Black Tooth tour”](https://archive.org/details/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-2011-posters/Capture%200.1.jpg). The song was released on *Willoughby’s Beach* on October 21st, 2011. In the following year it made an [appearance](https://youtu.be/-TSyRGzONMo?si=mR_9DWBneqBMeuDy) on the TV show *[Private Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Practice_(TV_series))* during the season five episode “Drifting Back.” It would also be used in a [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8pJ4zG0-J8) for the band’s 2018 vinyl reissues.

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokGGBuKpyw) for the song was released on Eric’s YouTube Channel (now King Gizzard’s) on June 8th, 2011 and shows two elephants with filters mirroring the footage, reversing it occasionally and shifting the color balance. It’s unclear who made the video as they were never credited in the comments or the video’s description though it was most likely Eric considering that his channel was used.

The song was reportedly played on [2011-08-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-19-2011-the-esplanade-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at The Esplanade Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne), but the first confirmed performance would be on [2011-10-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-17-2011-pbs-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at PBS Studios in Naarm (Melbourne) during a full performance of *Willoughby’s Beach*. The song would be in heavy rotation for 2012 and remained with the band for occasional performances going forward into 2013-2015. After a performance on [2015-09-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-13-2015-johnny-brendas-philadelphia-pa-usa.html) at Johnny Brenda’s in Philadelphia, the song would take a long break before reappearing at the Princess Theatre on [2021-12-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-22-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html) for “Garage Rock Night.” Following this, the song was played twice in 2022: on [2022-04-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-18-2022-event-lawn-at-virgin-hotels-las-vegas-las-vegas-nv-usa.html) in Las Vegas and on [2022-10-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-2-2022-william-randolph-hearst-greek-theatre-berkeley-ca-usa.html) in Berkeley.

Lunch Meat
With a simple set of lyrics about waking up in the morning and one of the fastest paces of any song on the *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)* EP, “Lunch Meat” is also the shortest at one minute and forty seconds.

A demo of the song was released on *[Demos Vol. 5: Music To Think Existentially To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-5-music-to-think-existentially-to)* and is double the length of the studio version at three minutes and eleven seconds. Unlike many demos from the timeframe, the “Lunch Meat” demo was recorded by the band rather than Stu alone. It features a few differences, such as the choruses lacking the melody heard in the final version and a slower, softer middle section that alternates between D and E before moving back to the chorus. The studio version was released on October 21st, 2011.

While first reported on [2010-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2010-unknown-venue-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), the earliest confirmed performance of “Lunch Meat” was at a supposed Christmas function for Forte Magazine at the Geelong Gaol in Geelong on [2011-02-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-12-2011-geelong-gaol-museum-geelong-vic-australia.html). These pre-*Willoughby’s* versions of the song are in line with the demo rather than the final studio version. While few performances of these songs from 2011-2012 are known, we do know that they switched away from the demo version. The final appearance of the song based on available information was on [2014-10-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-24-2014-brandeis-university-waltham-ma-usa-2.html) at Brandeis University in Waltham, with footage appearing in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=1514s)*.

Crookedile
“Crookedile” is a rowdy garage rock song based around one lyric: “just say God is on your side.” This makes “Crookedile” the first released Gizzard song to bring up any sort of religious or spiritual aspect, which is revisited later on songs like: [“God Is Calling Me Back Home,”](https://kglw.net/song/god-is-calling-me-back-home) [“God Is In The Rhythm”](https://kglw.net/song/god-is-in-the-rhythm) and [“Supreme Ascendancy.”](https://kglw.net/song/supreme-ascendancy) It’s also the first time the band has ever done anything related to crocodilians, which would end up being an iconic aspect of the band’s imagery — such as the gator seen in the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUZn1I6llJs&t=22s) for [“The River.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-river) “Crookedile” was released on October 21st, 2011 as the fourth song on *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)*.

The first confirmed appearance of the song was on [2011-08-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-19-2011-the-esplanade-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at The Esplanade Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). The song stayed in rotation from then until early 2013, with the last known performance being on [2013-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2013-corner-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Corner Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). Live performances of the song sometimes contained Stu singing the lyrics to The Stooges’ 1969 classic [“I Wanna Be Your Dog.”](https://kglw.net/song/i-wanna-be-your-dog)

Let It Bleed
Sharing its name with the 1969 Rolling Stones [album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_It_Bleed) and [song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_It_Bleed_(song)), “Let It Bleed” is the slowest track on *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)* and utilizes a single repeated lyric: “I want to see my love bird again.” The song contains an unusual mix for the timeframe, with acoustic guitars alongside reverb-drenched electric guitars, vocals, and harmonica.

A demo for the song was released on *[Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2)*. Unlike the final studio version, this version is faster and comes in about thirty seconds shorter. It was recorded by Stu on electric guitar, bass, drum machine, and vocals only. The studio version was released on October 21st, 2011.

Dead-Beat
“Dead-Beat” details an altercation leading to a bloody nose over an uncomplicated four-chord progression, and ends with a slow breakdown for its outro. The track was released on [September 14th 2011](http://whothehell.net/archives/12141) as the [second single](https://kglw.net/discography/dead-beat-promo) for *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)* (released on October 21st 2011) and would prove to be successful with [heavy rotation on Australian radio stations](https://web.archive.org/web/20111224015942/http://www.sonicbids.com/epk/epk.aspx?epk_id=317399) like Triple J, FBi, and PBS. It would even make it onto [Beat’s “Best Australian Singles” list](https://web.archive.org/web/20150326061903/http://www.beat.com.au/music/best-australian-singles-2012). The song’s success made it clear that they were capable of entering the industry, Eric [saying to Upstart](https://www.upstart.net.au/king-gizzard-brings-rocknroll-back-to-town/) “our single, ‘Dead-Beat,’ getting playlisted for high rotation on Triple J and being booked for Meredith really early on whipped us into line.”

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zTrV9uEq7w) for the song created by Sydrow Productions was released on October 19th, 2011. It shows the band playing the song on stage at two different venues with footage of the American wilderness and Native Americans interspersed.

The earliest known performance of “Dead-Beat” was on [2011-10-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-17-2011-pbs-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html") at PBS Studios in Naarm (Melbourne) during a full performance of *Willoughby’s Beach*. It would be played a few more times in 2011. Data on these early setlists is hard to come by, but the song was in rotation at least partially up until Glastonbury on [2015-06-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-27-2015-the-park-glastonbury-united-kingdom.html), after which it would take a three-year break with a small amount of footage appearing in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=1489s)*. “Dead-Beat” returned for brief appearances in late 2018 on [2018-11-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-24-2018-the-governor-hindmarsh-hotel-adelaide-sa-australia.html) and [2018-12-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-1-2018-royal-melbourne-showgrounds-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). Since then it has rarely been played, with only a couple of performances, such as on [2021-12-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-22-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html) for “Garage Rock Night” at The Princess Theatre in Brisbane.

Dustbin Fletcher
During the band’s performance on [2011-10-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-17-2011-pbs-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html"), Joey said “this next song is called ‘Dustbin Fletcher’, named after our favorite Essendon veteran.” That player is [Dustin Fletcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Fletcher), a footy player who played for [Essendon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essendon_Football_Club) from 1993 to 2015. While the song that follows has nothing to do with Fletcher’s career and focuses instead on feeling happy and good, “Dustbin Fletcher” is the first mention of footy in the band’s discography — later expanded upon with [“Footy Footy.”](https://kglw.net/song/footy-footy) It was released as the seventh song on *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach")* on October 21st, 2011.

Stoned Mullet
“Stoned Mullet” is a simple and immature three-chord garage rock song about getting stoned and masturbating. Stu even burps at the end of the track — hard to make it more crude than that. The title was taken from a band at Stu's High School. Introducing the song during a performance at PBS studios on [2011-10-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-17-2011-pbs-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), Stu explained: “when I was in high school there was a band called Stoned Mullet and I thought that was really cool.”  
The title is a play on the Australian phrase “like a stunned mullet,” meaning to be dazed or stupefied.

A demo for “Stoned Mullet” was released on *[Demos Vol. 3: Music To Eat Pond Scum To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-3)*. This version is not far from the final version and was recorded by Stu with vocals, electric guitar, bass, and a drum machine. Interestingly, the bass slide heard at the end of the demo appears at the beginning of [“Footy Footy”](https://kglw.net/song/footy-footy)’s demo, indicating that both were written at about the same time. Before the release of *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)*, the song was [introduced as “Jack-It”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8TTZeCSck4) live. A month before the release of the EP, the song appeared on the second Deaf Ambitions mixtape *[Deaf Ambitions Mixtape: Coast To Coast](https://kglw.net/discography/deaf-ambitions-mixtape-coast-to-coast)*. Here it was [listed](https://web.archive.org/web/20120109171519/https://deafambitions.blogspot.com/2011/09/deaf-ambitions-mixtape-coast-to-coast.html) as exclusive to the tape with the title “Jack-It and Green Out.” It’s unclear if this was the demo or the full studio version as the tape is no longer available.  “Stoned Mullet”, with its official title, was released on October 21st, 2011.

Aside from the above PBS performance, we only know of one other instance of the song being played live. This was at the High Noon Festival at the Northcote Social Club in Naarm (Melbourne) on [2011-09-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-18-2011-northcote-social-club-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html).

Willoughby’s Beach
“Just because I like you, it doesn’t mean I like you.” This contradictory phrase carries throughout the distorted two-chord title track of *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)* which ends the EP with a bang. In an interview for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203061920/http://messandnoise.com/citizenship/4372941), Eric revealed the inspiration for the song’s title. “Willoughby’s Beach is [a] small patch of sand by [the] banks of the Edward River in Deniliquin [Victoria].” This beach can be found at the [Deniliquin Campgrounds](https://www.visitthemurray.com.au/products/willoughbys-beach-campground). The song would be the [b-side](https://kglw.net/discography/black-toothwilloughbys-beach-single) of [“Black Tooth”](https://kglw.net/song/black-tooth) and was released on *Willoughby’s Beach* on October 21st, 2011.

It would also be played throughout 2012 with a performance from [2012-05-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-9-2012-kings-cross-hotel-potts-point-nsw-australia.html) being released as a [live video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrI7hfBIrdg) edited by The Brianstorm Project. From 2013 to 2015, only a few performances are known to exist. Following a performance at Glastonbury on [2015-06-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-27-2015-the-park-glastonbury-united-kingdom.html), which would appear in *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=1484s)*, the song would see a five year gap with a return on [2020-02-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-21-2020-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). It has made rare appearances since, surfacing for events such as “Garage Rock Night” on [2021-12-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-22-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html), and the band’s appearance at the Play On the Plains Festival on [2024-03-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-9-2024-deniliquin-festival-site-deniliquin-nsw-australia.html), only a short drive away from the beach itself.

12 Bar Bruise
Elbow
Starting King Gizzard’s [debut album](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise) with a bang, “Elbow” is a noisy, confrontational, but simple song that gets your blood flowing. It's a song about someone who sees themselves as a “big shot,” though they know that their provocations are only going to lead to pain. The lyrics are vague, but no doubt bitter. The band plays through heavy distortion on the song and chants “hey” throughout the choruses, giving the entire track a Ramones-like punk rock feel. That’s not to say, however, that “Elbow” is devoid of Gizzard’s flair, as the delayed guitars and unusual production choices set them well on their way toward a signature sound.


In a track-by-track rundown for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295), Stu said the song was “one of the oldest tracks on the album. We played it for the first time at Meredith last year, but I think it was pretty different back then. I can’t really remember. It has a huge flange on the end of the track, which is funny.” According to a recording of [2011-12-31](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-31-2011-the-esplanade-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), pre-*12 Bar Bruise* versions of the song feature different lyrics following “you are such a big shot.” It received a [single release](https://kglw.net/discography/elbow-single) on July 25th, 2012 on the [band’s Soundcloud page](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/photos/pb.100044289166773.-2207520000/477754042237504/?type=3) (the link is no longer working). It was released on *12 Bar Bruise* on September 7th, 2012 and was later used in [promotional material](https://www.instagram.com/p/BnYTOjzHhw9/) for the 2018 reissues of the band’s early material.

The song was debuted on [2011-12-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-9-2011-meredith-supernatural-amphitheatre-meredith-vic-australia.html) at the Meredith Music Festival and was played a number of times up to late 2013. After a performance on [2013-08-29](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-29-2013-northcote-social-club-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) it vanished from setlists. It would only be played a few more times in 2018, with one performance from [2018-10-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-4-2018-escena-monterrey-mexico.html) making it into the video *[KING GIZZ vs KEMONITO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw0yFGmB-AE)*. “Elbow” has not been seen since late 2018, though Cavs played the song briefly during his [drum seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9O9b-U0nl4&t=1381s) at Drumtek in Northcote in 2022.

Muckraker
A muckraker is a journalist who attempts (legitimately or not) to expose the secrets and injustices of corporations, politicians and industries, often with the intent to [cause a scandal or discuss reform](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/muckraker-word-history-meaning). “Muckraker” is also the name of a King Gizzard song featuring a number of tempo changes, recognizable delayed guitar parts, theremin, and vulgar lyrics. It was released as the second song on *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* on September 7th, 2012. Stu said this about “Muckraker” in a track-by-track rundown for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295). “One of the newest. It’s about being a shit kicker. A few people have said it sounds like Green Day, which is not really a good thing. Ah well.”

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2PjdldHnko) by Zonkvision (Jason Galea and Greg Holden) was released on October 1st, 2012. It shows the band performing the song with other shots of them swimming and golfing. According to an [interview for Speaker TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIJgqO6MKO4) the video was shot on the same day as the videos for [“Bloody Ripper”](https://kglw.net/song/bloody-ripper?artist_id=1) and [“Nein”](https://kglw.net/song/nein?artist_id=1), and filmed using old VHS cameras. The video was shot in Anglesea with a majority shot at the Coogoorah Reserve, while the golfing segments were filmed at the now closed Anglesea Power Station north of the park. The dog seen in the video is Stu’s dog Dipper.

Nein
“Nein” is a rhythmic, heavy and psychedelic garage rock track featuring high gain guitars, a tight rhythm section, a bunch of chanting vocals, and some theremin for good measure. The song is about drinking and how it makes the song’s narrator feel awful, its lyrics simply count up from one to nine, with the final number being replaced by the German word “nein,” meaning “no.”


During a track-by-track rundown of *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295), Stu said the song came out of a jam session of a song by The Clean. For promotion of the song, a [DIY shirt](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=503265859686322&set=a.503265679686340) was made in September of 2012. "Nein" was released on *12 Bar Bruise* that same month.

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLfhjrUI_uI) for “Nein” by Zonkvision (Jason Galea and Greg Holden) released on November 22nd, 2012 shows the band playing the song with flashing lights and other footage overlaid on top. According to an [interview for Speaker TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIJgqO6MKO4) the video was shot on the same day as the videos for [“Bloody Ripper”](https://kglw.net/song/bloody-ripper?artist_id=1) and [“Muckraker”](https://kglw.net/song/muckraker?artist_id=1) in Anglesea. In that same interview Eric mentions that the video was shot using old VHS cameras.


Based on available setlist data, “Nein” has never been played live.
12 Bar Bruise
Notorious for its recording method, “12 Bar Bruise” is the title track to the band’s [debut album](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise) with reverb-drenched guitar and rowdy lyrics about sex and booze. Its title is a play on the phrase “12 bar blues” — a common chord progression heard in blues and rock music.


“12 Bar Bruise” was recorded entirely using four or five iPhones according to a [Mess+Noise article](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295). In an [interview for FBI Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azuedaRzLzs) Stu said, “I think iPhones are absolutely unbelievable. The stuff you can do with them, just crazy. We used about five for that song all at the same time and mixed them together like that, so it kinda was better than one.” In a [Mixdown Magazine](https://web.archive.org/web/20130426232016/http://mixdownmag.com.au/2012/09/05/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard/) article, he elaborated that the band used the voice memo app, that it was mixed in Pro Tools with no processing, and that the vocals were recorded directly into one of the phones. The band found the experiment interesting, but there was some hesitancy to actually use it. As [Eric explained to Upstart](https://www.upstart.net.au/king-gizzard-brings-rocknroll-back-to-town/), “We basically recorded the song as an experiment and thought it sounded really cool, then for ages we were like ‘we can’t put this on the record, it’s absurd.’ Once we mixed it properly and got it mastered it didn’t actually sound that different sonically to the others, so we added it on. Now it’s the song people talk about the most.” At the time of release, the idea that the band had used iPhones in the recording process was both novel and nearly unheard of, leading to it becoming a feature touted in many articles and reviews of *12 Bar Bruise*. The band would continue to use this technique on future albums with [Stu noting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODI0x2unT2Q) how it allows instruments to cut through the mix. A [DIY shirt from the band with the song’s name](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/photos/pb.100044289166773.-2207520000/507474029265505/?type=3) painted on it would be sold in late 2012, with the song being included on *12 Bar Bruise* on September 7th of that year. It would later be used in [promotional material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8pJ4zG0-J8) for the 2018 reissues.


Little info is known about the band’s sets from this era. The only reported performance of the song was on [2012-10-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-7-2012-the-tote-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at The Tote Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) with a [Tone Deaf article](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-7-2012-the-tote-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) noting it as the opener.
Garage Liddiard
Gareth Liddiard is an Australian musician known for his work in The Drones and Tropical Fuck Storm, as well as his own solo career. King Gizzard would [tour with The Drones in 2013](https://themusic.com.au/reviews/the-drones-the-tivoli-nick-wright/evhtbG9ukZA/16-04-13) and work with Gareth on *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)*. Portions of these sessions were used on the Tropical Fuck Storm collaborative EP *[Satanic Slumber Party](https://kglw.net/discography/satanic-slumber-party)* and served to inspire the *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)* classic, [“The Dripping Tap.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-dripping-tap?artist_id=1) Yet before any of that, he was given a nod with the short garage rock song “Garage Liddiard.”

It originally started out as a [“Twist and Shout”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_and_Shout)-like song according to a [Mess+Noise track-by-track breakdown](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295), but was changed when producer Paul Maybury told them a faster version could be more interesting. Stu said during an [interview for FBI Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azuedaRzLzs) that the title was essentially meaningless. “It’s not meant to be anything super smart, or like, super witty or anything. It’s just a bit of a play on words…” Eric chimes in saying “Joe, our guitarist, just said it one day and we thought it was hilarious… but we are massive fans of Gaza and The Drones so it’s definitely not a dig in any way. It’s more of an ode.” When asked if Gareth had heard the song, Eric said that he thinks he hasn’t heard it but knows of it. In another [interview for Beat](https://web.archive.org/web/20140309074555/http://www.beat.com.au/music/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard) Eric said “I think with ‘Garage Liddiard’ we just needed a title and Joe was saying all this funny stuff then came up with that. It’s a garage-y song and we all love The Drones. But at the same time, it’s kind of what Gizzard is – that simple, Aussie fun.”  It was released on *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* on September 7th, 2012.


Based on available setlist data, “Garage Liddiard” has never been played live.
Sam Cherry’s Last Shot
**This song contains subject matter that may not be suitable for all readers as it deals with the topic of self harm/suicide.** 


At the end of chapter thirty-nine of the 1882 book *[33 Years Among Our Wild Indians](https://archive.org/details/ourwildindians00dodgrich/page/520/mode/2up)*, Richard Irving Dodge described a grizzly scene from his time in the United States Army. From October 10th to October 30th of 1855, Dodge escorted and protected a group of privates and officers in Fort Davis, Texas. Included in the group was Sam Cherry, a guide who was navigating the land in search of wood. On the night of the 30th, Dodge reported to a colonel and asked if he would be needed for Muster Day (a day of enrollment). The colonel, having forgotten about the event, told Dodge to assign someone else to guard Cherry’s group — that being one Sgt. Love. On the morning of October 31st however, Love, Cherry and the rest did not return to the fort. An investigation began after a report of a dead body; and what they found was Sam Cherry dead, pinned under his horse. Sgt. Love and the rest of the group were found later, mutilated and killed. They came to a conclusion later that day: while traveling they were ambushed by Native Americans. Sam Cherry managed to break through their blockade, but his horse fell and broke its neck, holding Cherry in place as they advanced. Grabbing his gun, he fired at them five times before pointing the barrel of his gun at his forehead and pulling the trigger, shocking his pursuers who then ran off. The title of this section of the book? “Sam Cherry’s Last Shot.”  
This passage was recited on the *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* song of the same name. By far the most unique track on the album, it’s an Ennio Morricone-like rock song narrated by Carson/Dingoes member and father of Ambrose Kenny-Smith, Broderick Smith. It was his first appearance in the band’s discography, and laid the foundation for the band’s second album *[Eyes Like the Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)*, another piece of American western writing. It’s also the first moment Gizzard has ever confronted the topic of colonialism, a practice that would be criticized both within the band’s discography and outside of it.


“Sam Cherry’s Last Shot” was originally an instrumental before the addition of narration. [According to Stu](https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/king-gizzard-release-psychedelic-western-audiobook-lp/), they had originally thought of using a section of Cormac McCarthy’s 1985 classic *[Blood Meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Meridian)*. Joey was reading it at the time (as part of his [“Nick Cave” phase](https://uproxx.com/indie/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-review-discography/)) and was [inspired by a clip](https://soundcloud.com/leahaphillips/interview-king-gizzard-and-the) of someone reading from it on Youtube. When Broderick Smith got involved [he suggested](https://happymag.tv/eyes-like-the-sky/) *33 Years Among Our Wild Indians* instead. The song was first heard when it was released as the [b-side](https://kglw.net/discography/bloody-ripper-single) of [“Bloody Ripper”](https://kglw.net/song/bloody-ripper) on April 3rd, 2012. It would later be released as part of the band’s debut album *12 Bar Bruise* on September 7th, 2012.

On May 14th, 2012, a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K9zDPqN9XM) for the song by Zonkvision was released. It features clips of the 1967 film *[Death Rides a Horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Rides_a_Horse)* with oil projections and analog video on top of it. According to a [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100841/http://messandnoise.com/news/4471542) article, this video, as well as “Bloody Ripper,” were both edited in a few hours.

The earliest performance of the song was on [2012-07-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-20-2012-the-bridge-hotel-castlemaine-vic-australia.html) at The Bridge Hotel in Castlemaine. In this performance, Broderick starts earlier than the studio version (leading with the line “from about the 10th to the 30th, I had thus been out, taking a different route each day”) and continues reading past the end of the chapter. One other performance is known, that being on [2013-04-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-19-2013-astor-theatre-perth-wa-australia.html) at the Astor Theatre in Perth, although it’s unclear if this was played with Broderick Smith or any narration.
High Hopes Low
“High Hopes Low” starts the second side of *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* (released September 7th, 2012) with an iconic electronic drum beat before leading into a rowdy garage rock song with very simplistic lyrics about expectations and intelligence. In a track-by-track rundown of *12 Bar Bruise* for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295), Stu stated that the song is actually composed of two separate takes:  
“Recorded in two separate sessions a month apart. One was kinda hi-fi-ish, with all the instruments panned wide, and the other was really crunchy, with everything dead centre. Really different recordings. We spliced the two recordings up and now the song switches between the two. It sounds cool in headphones.” Some fans have noted the similarities between “High Hopes Low” and the Osees track [“Grease 2”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUByoYj7Lso) released on the 2008 album *[The Master's Bedroom Is Worth Spending a Night In](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master%27s_Bedroom_Is_Worth_Spending_a_Night_In)* We know that King Gizzard took a ton of influence from the band in the early 2010s with [Stu saying to Triple J](https://web.archive.org/web/20111129014623/http://www.triplejunearthed.com/Artists/FeaturedArtist.aspx?artistid=41113) “I don’t think we’ve developed a sound. We’re still just fucking around in the garage. I think we’re just making loud noises and passing it off as music. Basically I just took the best songs from the best Oh Sees records and added a Bo Diddley beat.”


The first confirmed performance of “High Hopes Low” was on [2011-12-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-9-2011-meredith-supernatural-amphitheatre-meredith-vic-australia.html) and it would be played a number of times from 2011 to 2013. The final known performance was on [2013-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-9-2011-meredith-supernatural-amphitheatre-meredith-vic-australia.html) at the Corner Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). Based on available recordings, versions past 2011 feature the song’s intro.

Cut Throat Boogie
**This song contains gory subject matter that may not be suitable for all readers.**


One of the most important songs on *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* is “Cut Throat Boogie,” a high energy and raunchy rock song about a party gone dangerously wrong. The track would be a trailblazer for the band in a few ways. On one hand it's the first song by King Gizzard sung by Ambrose, who would begin to form his identity as a frontman within Gizzard following the song’s release. Larger than that however, it’s the first song in the band’s entire discography not led by Stu, leading to further band introductions on albums like *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* and *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)*. On the other hand it also serves as the first boogie in the band’s discography — a trend that will return on albums like *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)* and *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)*. While not the most common song in the band’s arsenal, this sub-three minute song is the origin point of many defining characteristics of King Gizzard.

The song was inspired by a close call Ambrose experienced. In a [YouTube live chat](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/p2d0xf/ambrose_on_the_story_of_cut_throat_boogie_on_the/), Ambrose wrote, “‘Cut Throat Boogie’ is about me getting my throat cut. I was at a party when I was sixteen and a friend broke a bottle and was being silly and grabbed me from behind and I leant into the bottle. The bottle cut my neck and blood was pissing out everywhere. The doctor said I was an inch from my jugular. The friend ended up hanging out with gangs and I joined bands. The rest is history.” The lyrics also bring up his [childhood habit of folding his ears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW03AAEYaiQ&t=43s) with the line “as a child I felt inclined to fold my ears in twine.” At a show on [2022-04-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-24-2022-alex-madonna-expo-center-san-luis-obispo-ca-usa.html), Ambrose says that they “ripped off my dad” with the song. Ambrose’s father is Broderick Smith, a former member of the boogie rock band Carson. Stu mentioned in a track-by-track rundown for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295) that it was directly influenced by the Carson song “Boogie” and mixed in dual mono. The song was released on September 7th, 2012 as part of *12 Bar Bruise*. An [early DIY shirt](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=503266043019637&set=a.503265679686340) features the song’s name.

The first confirmed appearance of the song was on [2012-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2012-acdc-lane-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at Cherryfest in Naarm (Melbourne), and it would be played occasionally in the following years, usually making a few appearances each year. A 2015 performance from Glastonbury on [2015-06-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-27-2015-the-park-glastonbury-united-kingdom.html) appears in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=1213s)*. Live versions often didn’t stray far from the studio version until 2022, when they would sometimes extend past the five-minute mark. “Cut Throat Boogie” is the most played song from *12 Bar Bruise*.

Bloody Ripper
Appearing late into *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)*, “Bloody Ripper” is a simple mid-tempo garage rock song described as a “half hate ballad, half love song” by [Beat](https://beat.com.au/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-12-bar-bruise/). The song was released as a [single](https://kglw.net/discography/bloody-ripper-single) on April 3rd, 2012 with the b-side of [“Sam Cherry’s Last Shot.”](https://kglw.net/song/sam-cherrys-last-shot) It was put on *12 Bar Bruise* (released on September 7th, 2012), and its title was later used for a promotional [DIY shirt](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=503265739686334&set=a.503265679686340). An [early tour](https://beat.com.au/king-gizzard-bloody-ripper-tour/) for the band was named the [“Bloody Ripper Tour”](https://archive.org/download/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-2012-posters_202112/1.1%20Capture%2019.1.JPG) as well. In a track-by-track rundown of *12 Bar Bruise* for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295), Stu stated, “Producer Paul Maybury of Rocket Science is a big fan of Wreckless Eric and Stiff Records in general, so there was a lot of that playing in the studio. I think a little bit of that rubbed off on ‘Bloody Ripper’ in a weird way. In the end of the song we slowly sped the song up, with the pitch going with it. It’s kinda like a key change, but more confusing.”

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbHJLKO41-o) for “Bloody Ripper” by Zonkvision was released on May 14th, 2012. It shows the band playing the song (occasionally wearing lucha libre masks) with other clips of them overlaid on top. It was filmed and edited by Jason Galea and Greg Holden and was Galea’s first directing gig according to an [interview with No Film School](https://nofilmschool.com/2016/auteurs-music-video-jason-galea). According to an [interview for Speaker TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIJgqO6MKO4), the video was shot on the same day as the videos for [“Muckraker”](https://kglw.net/song/muckraker?artist_id=1) and [“Nein”](https://kglw.net/song/nein?artist_id=1) in Anglesea. In that same interview, Eric mentions that the video was shot using old VHS cameras. According to a [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100841/http://messandnoise.com/news/4471542) article, this video, as well as “Sam Cherry’s Last Shot,” were edited in a few hours. One of the lucha libre masks seems to appear in the [Zonkvision Exhibition Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEY2aUGmAds). The same day the official video was uploaded to Zonkvision’s channel, the Flightless channel uploaded a [live video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYw_WOFD4vI) of the song edited by the Brianstorm Project.

The first confirmed performance of the song was on [2012-05-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-11-2012-rozelle-hospital-for-the-insane-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html) at the Rozelle Hospital for the Insane in Eora (Sydney). Based on available setlist data the song was played throughout 2012 into 2013 with its last known appearance on [2013-04-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-20-2013-the-governor-hindmarsh-hotel-adelaide-sa-australia.html) at the Governor Hindmarsh Hotel in Adelaide.
Uh Oh, I Called Mum
“Uh Oh, I Called Mum” follows someone who takes a “glob” (most likely cannabis oil) and gets anxious, leading to them calling their mom to calm down. The song is seemingly inspired by The Ramones and early surf rock. It’s fast, loud and no doubt silly.

While on [Mornings With Zan on Triple J](https://web.archive.org/web/20121114091924/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/zan/blog/s3583506.htm), Eric explained that the song was inspired by a real life event. “It came from an experience Lucas had at Golden Plains actually, this year I think, while listening to, was it um… Charles Bradley? Just watching him play, this incredible old soul singer like absolutely so sort of like, heartfelt and this amazing performance and Lucas just kind of started to, you know, get a little bit anxious or a little bit excited and he kind of freaked out a little bit and ended up in the medical tent and he called his mum. Cause that was the only thing that was gonna sort of make him feel better, was calling his mum. Yeah, and that’s kind of how this story evolved and Stu decided to write a little tune about it.” He jokingly adds “We could never sort of, never let him get away with it so I guess we put it in a song so now it’s just out there forever.” Charles Bradley’s performance would have been on [March 11th, 2012](https://consequence.net/2011/12/charles-bradley-schedules-2012-tour-dates/). Exact recording dates for the band are hard to come by, but we know that at least some vocal overdubs were done on May 26th, 2012 as they [uploaded a video of Ambrose screaming the intro](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10150977557907755) to their Facebook page. It was released on *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* on September 7th, 2012.


The first known performance of “Uh Oh, I Called Mum” was on [2012-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2012-acdc-lane-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at Cherryfest. The only other known performance was on [2013-02-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-8-2013-pbs-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) for PBS radio.

Sea of Trees
**This song contains subject matter that may not be suitable for all readers as it deals with the topic of self harm/suicide.** 


In the Yamanashi Prefecture of Japan, right next to Mount Fuji, is a thirty-kilometer-wide forest known as Aokigahara, or the “sea of trees.” Despite the forest’s scenic beauty, Aokigahara is infamous for the number of suicides that happen there. Specific numbers are hard to come by but [thousands have taken their lives](http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/03/19/suicide.forrest.japan/) there over the years with it becoming a notorious location referenced in films like *[The Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forest_(2016_American_film))*, as well as books such as *Nami no Tō (Tower of Waves)*, often reported as the novel that led to the trend. In 2012, the forest would become the topic of a short, emotional garage rock song by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard.


The title “Sea of Trees” was [originally conceived](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1622452830190862336?s=46&t=B6su2K8v-sosn58jPTf1Kw) as the band’s name. Stu recalled the story for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295): “Just as King Gizzard was forming, Eric [Moore] went to a [Gareth] Liddiard show where he talked about ‘the Sea of Trees’ in Japan, a place where businessmen go to commit suicide. This actually ended up being our band name for a couple of our early shows and also seemed like a fitting title to this song.” In an [interview for SYN radio](https://soundcloud.com/monsebire/interview-with-joe-walker-king), Joey mentioned their old name while noting how “morbid” it was. He brings up a “haunting” [VICE documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDSdg09df8) as a good watch. They abandoned the name due to it being [“a bit too dark”](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6pllv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and instead used it as a song title later on. Originally “Sea of Trees” may have been called [“Jam.”](https://kglw.net/song/jam) The band uploaded the song to the [Flightless Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/flightlessrecords/11-jam-1) on July 6th, 2012 with that title. Adding onto this, there’s an [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396573) entry listed sometime before the release of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)*, as well as a brief appearance on the setlist for [2012-05-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-9-2012-kings-cross-hotel-potts-point-nsw-australia.html). That said, it’s unclear if these meant an early “Sea of Trees” or something else entirely. Eventually the band decided to use the rejected band name as the song’s title, which appeared on the release of *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* on September 7th, 2012.  The song has a unique, haunting ending that cuts out quickly. According to the Mess+Noise article, it happened due to the band running out of tape. Interestingly, the lyrics to the verse have changed over time. Original pressings of *12 Bar Bruise*, as well as the 2023 reissues, have liner notes featuring a drawing of a tattooed man. On these, we see the original final line “and when you’re feeling suicidal, some times you just have to end it.” For the 2018 reissues, however, there were new liner notes. These replace the original line with “and when you’re feeling suicidal, sometimes you just have to unfold” — making it noticeably less dark. According to Joey before a performance of the song on [2022-10-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-11-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html), “Sea of Trees” is Lucas’s favorite Gizzard song.

If “Jam” is “Sea of Trees,” the first reported performance would be on [2012-05-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-9-2012-kings-cross-hotel-potts-point-nsw-australia.html) at the Kings Cross Hotel in Potts Point. However, if this is not the case, the earliest would be on [2012-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2012-acdc-lane-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) during the band’s Cherryfest performance. Setlist data for many of these early shows is hard to come by so it’s hard to see if it was ever that common, but we know that it appeared at least a few times from 2012 to 2014. A slowed-down performance from [2014-10-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-24-2014-brandeis-university-waltham-ma-usa-2.html) appears in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=1203s)*. The song would disappear after this gig, though it appeared briefly as teases in various others. After a long break, “Sea of Trees” reappeared on [2020-02-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-21-2020-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) during the band’s marathon show. Unlike previous versions, this performance is slightly longer at a bit over five minutes and features an improvised intro. Following this, “Sea of Trees” began to stretch to and above the ten-minute mark while also being paired with other songs like [“Trapdoor”](https://kglw.net/song/trapdoor) and [“Head On/Pill.”](https://kglw.net/song/head-on-pill) To further complicate the lyric issues, some performances of the song feature new lyrics such as [2022-05-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-20-2022-agora-cleveland-oh-usa.html), which replaces the words “end it”/”unfold” with “ignore it.” In a [Relix interview](https://relix.com/articles/detail/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-a-beautiful-mind-fuzz/) Stu mentioned that “Sea of Trees” is an easy song to bring on tour because it doesn’t require much rehearsal.

Footy Footy
An ode to the sport of Australian football, “Footy Footy” is a fast garage rock song with blaring harmonica, crowd vocals, and references to twenty-one different players and teams.


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EhlnHLe1k1A?si=6rBLJ4AYe2cwwnGC&amp;start=2344" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


A demo was released on *[Demos Vol. 1: Music To Kill Bad People To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-1)*. The recording is short, at one minute and thirty-eight seconds and features distorted guitar, vocals and drum machine— typical of Gizzard demos from the time. It doesn’t stray far from the final version, but doesn’t contain the tempo change at the end and has a longer intro. Interestingly, the bass slide at the beginning of the song is from the demo of [“Stoned Mullet,”](https://kglw.net/song/stoned-mullet) showing that both were written around the same time. During an [interview with Zan Rowe from Triple J](https://web.archive.org/web/20121114091924/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/zan/blog/s3583506.htm), Eric explains the origins of the song, even saying there was some hesitancy to put the song out. “Stu kind of wrote it as, once again, just an absolute gag song. Like it was just an absolute joke and we thought ‘oh we can never play this’ like we didn’t know how people would take it or if they would like, hate us, or if all of the sudden we’d just become this band that has the ‘footy’ song or something like that… and um, yeah, we’re just in the studio and this song was kinda done and then Joe, like, our guitarist, just starting like doing these really funny voiceovers of all these favorite players and we’re like ‘you gotta record that, you gotta add that in’ so now it’s just like the whole song is just a roll call of all these mid-90s like underappreciated AFL players.” In an [interview for Beat](https://web.archive.org/web/20140309074555/http://www.beat.com.au/music/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard), he elaborated on those Joey mentioned: “The players Joe was naming are from our era when we all grew up—’96, ’97. It’s when we were like ten and loving footy. It’s probably an album that will polarise people. So many people will be like ‘this is dumb, what is this shit’. Then there will be people that will get it straight away and it’ll just click with them. I guess we’ll see how it goes.” During a track-by-track rundown for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295), Stu said “‘Footy Footy’ is about footy. It’s kind of serious but kind of not. I kind of love footy, but it’s kind of funny to joke about it sometimes too. Joe [Walker] ad-libbed through all his favorite footballers and the spoken-word part at the end in his best footy-boy voice. This song is the shittest song on the album, so we put it at the end.” It was released on *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* on September 7th, 2012. 


Despite writing an entire song about the sport, Stu has made his distaste for the sport clear in the band’s [Reddit AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge7k2uo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and before various performances of the song. On [2014-10-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-24-2014-brandeis-university-waltham-ma-usa-2.html) for example, he said “this song’s about footy. I fuckin’ hate footy!” It seems to be a bit tongue in cheek however, as Stu was once a team captain for Geelong Junior Football League, though [ABC reports](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-11-22/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-sponsor-anglesea-womens-football-club/101661018) that he stopped playing due to an ACL injury. Beyond Stu, Lucas is a fan of Geelong and has shown his support during various [Reddit AMAs](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3e5vj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The band also [sponsored Anglesea FNC](https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-sponsoring-womens-football-team-in-anglesea-3353972) in 2021. The AFL has also crossed paths with Gizzard a handful of times, most notably with this [song’s inclusion](https://vgost.fandom.com/wiki/AFL_Live_2) in the video game *[AFL Live 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL_Live_2)*, released September 12th, 2013. The band [posted](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/posts/our-song-footy-footy-is-featured-on-the-new-afl-live-gamewe-like-what-this-game-/679125145433725/) about its inclusion, writing “we like what this game has become,” a rewrite of Joey’s final adlib. AFL player Patrick Dangerfield [called King Gizzard his favorite band](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/1bouz0b/afl_player_patrick_dangerfield_is_a_gizz_fan/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Eyes Like The Sky
Eyes Like The Sky
With spaghetti western guitars and cracking gunfire, the title track of *[Eyes Like The Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)* acts as a prologue that sets up the narrated story of the album, which is named after its protagonist. Taking place in the southwest United States before and after the American Civil War, the lands are filled with bloodshed and fighting over territory and belief. Out of that turmoil rises a figure who makes a number of names for himself through violence. *Eyes Like The Sky* is his story.
The music starts with a slow build before moving into an epic riff, backed by two powerful hits by the band. The song itself opens with a distorted lead line that conveys the vast frontier of the story.  It was first revealed on January 6th, 2013 as part of the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYrUQAlaQOw) for the album and was released properly on February 22nd, 2013.

The earliest known performance of the song was on [2013-11-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-13-2013-triple-r-performance-space-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) for Triple R Radio. This version was performed with Broderick Smith, who provided narration which features extra lyrics in the first passage. He introduces the story of *Eyes Like The Sky* by saying “In the life and adventures of M. O’Brien. Scout, pioneer, gunfighter and Yavapai warrior.” The song wouldn’t be seen again until [2016-02-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-february-17-2016-fleece-bristol-england.html) at Fleece in Bristol—three years after the song’s release. Broderick Smith returned to the track on [2018-12-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-1-2018-royal-melbourne-showgrounds-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds in Naarm (Melbourne) for Gizzfest.

Year Of Our Lord
Chapter one of *[Eyes Like the Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)* starts on June 12th, 1854 in the Arizona territory. While this is eight years before the American Civil War, it’s directly in the middle of the [Yavapai Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavapai_Wars), and the broader [Apache Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Wars#). Two Yavapai-Apache men watch a small farmhouse lived in by a white family: a tall man, a woman, two shorter men, who they assume are their children, and a kid who follows behind his mother. Only an hour away is a group of eight armed men approaching the farmstead. The reason they’re here is to raid the ranch, as it was easier to take from the white men of the Arizona desert than the Mexican troopers who roamed the land. After a signal from one of the watchers, the raid begins. “Year Of Our Lord” is a powerful song with prominent bass, a catchy country guitar line and a great groove. It was released on February 22nd, 2013.

The Raid
Proceeding directly after the events of [“Year Of Our Lord”](https://kglw.net/song/year-of-our-lord); “The Raid” tells of the Yavapai-Apache men who kill the adults in the farmstead after gaining word from the watcher. They take only the weapons and the children, so that the Yavapai-Apache people can raise them as their own to help during the Yavapai Wars. In the attack, they take a five year old Miguel O’Brien. Soundtracking the attack is a rowdy, triplet-filled spaghetti western instrumental with reverb crackling (most likely a Danelectro Spring Pedal used to similar effect on [“Hot Wax”](https://kglw.net/song/hot-wax)) and the sounds of metal clanging. According to a [Happy Magazine](https://happymag.tv/eyes-like-the-sky/) article with Broderick Smith, Miguel O’Brien’s kidnapping was based on [Comanche raids](https://www.npr.org/2011/05/20/136438816/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-comanche-empire) in the 1800s. “I based [the story] on that and that’s what they wanted.” The song is a springy rock track with notable tremolo picking, upbeat drums, and a variety of sound effects. It was released on February 22nd, 2013.

The first known performance of “The Raid” was on [2013-10-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-16-2013-red-bennies-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Red Bennies in Naarm (Melbourne) which was featured on the [third episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d9y740LUCk&t=0s) of the show *ABABCd*. The band would play the song again a few days later on [2013-10-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-19-2013-corner-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Corner Hotel also in Naarm. These performances of the song do not feature Broderick Smith’s narration and are instrumental renditions of the track. During a performance on Triple R Radio on [2013-11-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-13-2013-triple-r-performance-space-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), Broderick joined the band for “The Raid” and provided narration. Five years later on [2018-12-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-1-2018-royal-melbourne-showgrounds-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) during Gizzfest at the Royal Melbourne Showgrounds, Broderick Smith returned to the track for what would be his final performance of the song. The band played it on [2023-06-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-21-2023-hollywood-bowl-los-angeles-ca-usa.html) at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles as a tribute to Broderick, his narration played over the PA.

Drum Run
Chapter two of *[Eyes Like The Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)* follows the aftermath of the raid. After being taken by the Yavapai-Apache men, Miguel O’Brien trains with them for ten years and learns a variety of new skills, such as hunting and running without leaving tracks. Despite his race, he is respected for his abilities and bravery and welcomed as a part of the tribe. At sixteen in the year 1864, he no longer goes by Miguel O’Brien. He instead is given the name “Eyes Like The Sky,” referring to his blue eyes. Like its name implies, the song is dominated by the sound of pounding drums but the rhythm is accompanied by harmonica, chanting, and reverberated crashing sounds similar to those heard in [“Hot Wax.”](https://kglw.net/song/hot-wax) The song was released on February 22nd, 2013 and was later used in the promotional video *[REISSUES CONFIRMED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8pJ4zG0-J8)* for the band’s 2018 reissues of their early work.


“Drum Run” has never been played live.
Evil Man
While Eyes Like The Sky lived and trained alongside the Yavapai-Apaches, the American Civil War had begun, though the fighting had not made it to Arizona. Yet one morning a group of Americans appeared, led by an “evil man” carrying a bible (later named The God Man). His group of soldiers attacked the Yavapai-Apache settlement in the name of their lord and killed most of them. While Miguel tried to run, he was struck on the head by the butt of a rifle and taken by the Americans after they noticed his blue eyes. As Broderick Smith puts it, “once more, a family he loved had been killed, this time, by Americans.” “Evil Man” starts ominously with distorted, echoing sounds before the introduction of a sinister guitar riff and groove featuring falsetto vocals from Ambrose and Stu. It was released on February 22nd, 2013 as the fifth song on *[Eyes Like The Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)*.

The earliest performance of “Evil Man” that we know of was on [2013-04-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-19-2013-astor-theatre-perth-wa-australia.html) at the Astor Theatre in Perth. At the time the band were playing it as an instrumental without Broderick’s narration (as seen with [2013-06-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-23-2013-elsternwick-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html)). On [2013-11-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-13-2013-triple-r-performance-space-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) Broderick joined the band on this song for a Triple R performance, giving the only known live version to feature his narration. Three years later the song was played at least twice in February of 2016 ([2016-02-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-15-2016-gorilla-manchester-england.html) and [2016-02-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-february-18-2016-electric-ballroom-london-england.html)). The latest appearance of “Evil Man” was on [2023-06-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-21-2023-hollywood-bowl-los-angeles-ca-usa.html) at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles with Broderick’s narration played over the speakers.

Fort Whipple
As chapter three begins, we learn that “Eyes Like The Sky” is taken (alongside Yavapai girls) to Fort Whipple, an American settlement run by a man named Willis. Talking to the God Man, they assume that he is either Miguel O’Brien or a part of the Jepson party which had gone missing while heading towards New Mexico. Not knowing his identity, the men name him Jepson O’Brien though others simply call him Blue. While most men refused to get close to him, a fur trapper did and taught him how to speak, read, and write English while allowing him to be part of his team. At only seventeen, he had developed a reputation of being fast and dangerous when he needed to be. “Fort Whipple” is based on the real site and its people. The [fort itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Whipple,_Arizona) resided in Prescott, Arizona while Willis refers to [Major Edward Banker Willis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Banker_Willis), an officer who was behind the creation of the fort in 1863. In the story of *Eyes Like The Sky*, Blue was brought to the camp only a year after it had begun being used by the United States Army. While Broderick Smith narrates the track, the band plays a steady spaghetti western-inspired “surf dirge” dominated by reverb-soaked guitars and the sound of wind. In the [liner notes](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/eyes-like-the-sky) for the 2018 reissue of *Eyes Like The Sky*, Stu wrote that “Fort Whipple” was one of the first tracks made for the album and that it was recorded in his parent’s garage in Anglesea by himself, Cavs, and Lucas. It was released on *[Eyes Like The Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)* on February 22nd, 2013.

The God Man’s Goat Lust
**This song contains subject matter that may not be suitable for all readers as it deals with the topic of sexual assault.**


Chapter four begins in the backroom of a chapel at Fort Whipple. Here, the God Man satisfies his “goat-lust” with a Yavapai girl taken during the attack. A gun is pointed to her head while she is pushed onto the altar. She never says a word. When the God Man ends his assault, he walks out the door to the front of the chapel but is killed by Blue who comes up behind him with a knife and slices his neck. Seeing the girl, he grabs weapons, money and resources as well as two horses, and the Yavapai take off into the desert. The atmospheric instrumental starts with creepy, discordant piano and echoing guitar before reaching a steady beat after the God Man is killed, which releases the tension. Despite the song's uncomfortable subject matter, the band created a [t-shirt](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/z42muo/old_merch_the_band_had_from_2012_2014_all_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) with its name. Designed by Cangkang Serigala, it [depicts](http://cangkangserigala.blogspot.com/2013_02_01_archive.html) the head of Jesus Christ wearing his crown of thorns with his beard transforming into the face of a goat. “The God Man’s Goat Lust” was released on February 22nd, 2013 on *[Eyes Like The Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)*.

The Killing Ground
Chapter five follows Blue and the Yavapai girl as they escape Fort Whipple. The two exchange names and ride until the horses can't run anymore. From there they walk across Arizona towards Apache territory, hearing the sound of gunfire and horses in the distance, and seeing clouds of dust fly into the air. The following day they discover what has happened. A group of Americans, all dead on the ground. The details of the scene are inconsistent with the tactics of Native Americans,—the white men had staged a raid. They took what they could and began running once more. According to Stu’s [liner notes](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/eyes-like-the-sky) for the album’s 2018 reissue, this was one of the first songs recorded for *[Eyes Like The Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)*. It was performed by Cavs, Lucas, and Stu in his parent’s garage in Anglesea. The recording location is evident in the final take as the sound of Stu’s father is heard banging a rusted saw blade alongside the sounds of the family dogs. “The Killing Ground” is the calmest track on *Eyes Like The Sky* with strummed acoustic guitar and whistling, though the sinister guitar work gives the music a sense of unease. It was released on February 22nd, 2013.


“The Killing Ground” has never been played live.
Dust In The Wind
As they begin to run away from the killing ground, the Yavapai girl is shot. Blue ducks behind a rock and watches the girl die, before noticing where the shots had come from. Thus begins chapter six. Seeing where the men are, Blue sneaks through the trees and bushes while making out that there are four men: three hunters and a man watching the horses. Blue takes out the man by the horses and ties their leads to a tree for later. He then targets the three others from a distance with a rifle he had taken. One stands guard while the other two examine the body. Blue shoots the head of the standing man while the others cower in fear. He then blasts one of their right legs off. This is only the beginning of Blue’s plans. “Dust In The Wind” is a suspenseful track led by heavy drumming and decorated with strange piano and high-pitched, feedback-like tones. It was released on February 22nd, 2013 on *[Eyes Like The Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky).* 


“Dust In The Wind” has not been played live.
Guns & Horses
After attacking the two remaining men, Blue takes off with the horses and all of their gear to head to a Yavapai stronghold. He finds comfort in their cries as he knows that the two men are left in the middle of the wilderness alone without food, water or any tools all while dressed as Yavapai-Apaches. A slow, painful fate awaits them. While they die in the wilderness, Blue drinks and eats with the thought of their deaths in his mind.  Blue’s story is left open-ended at the conclusion of “Guns & Horses”, leaving the possibility for a sequel. In 2014 Stu said to [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20141112132955/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4574833) “I want to do a follow-up one day. He [the protagonist] was pretty young at the end of the story so it’s got plenty of time for him to go on (an)other adventure.” Broderick [said to Happy Magazine](https://happymag.tv/eyes-like-the-sky/)  "we did talk about taking the character and bringing him over here [to Australia] for the gold fields or the opium wars in China or something, because at the end of the story he's gone. He could be going anywhere." Ultimately the sequel to *[Eyes Like the Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)* was never recorded by the band, leaving O’Brien’s story at this violent moment. “Guns & Horses” is the shortest track on Eyes Like The Sky and features acoustic guitar, pounding drums, and a sinister guitar line, as well as the sounds of horses and vibraslap. It was released on February 22nd, 2013.

Float Along — Fill Your Lungs
Head On/Pill
King Gizzard has been known to jam and improv. For fans who came in post-COVID pandemic, songs like [“The Dripping Tap”](https://kglw.net/song/the-dripping-tap) and [“Ice V”](https://kglw.net/song/ice-v) might come to mind as examples of their jam band sensibilities. Those who came before may point to songs like [“Am I In Heaven?”](https://kglw.net/song/am-i-in-heaven) But the band’s interest in jamming was first made clear in 2013 with the opener of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)*, “Head On/Pill.” At a total runtime of fifteen minutes and fifty-nine seconds, the song was the band’s first jam, and a turning point into more psychedelic music perfect for live shows. The first section, “Head On,” is a droning psychedelic rock song with an iconic riff, its lyrics detailing what seems to be a trip that its narrator was trying to keep composure during. The second section, “Pill,” is a fast and energetic piece with simple lyrics about eating “the wrong pill.” Since its release, the song has remained an essential part of the band’s discography and still stuns audiences to this day.

The earliest history of the song came out of jam sessions. According to the [liner notes](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/float-along-fill-your-lungs) for the 2018 reissue of the album, it wasn’t meant to be anything huge but couldn’t limit itself. “We were playing a lot of shows and had started jamming and improvising a lot live. Out of the ether came ‘Head On/Pill.’ It was short at first but it just kept fucking growing like pond scum. We thought we had better record it before we forgot it so we spent a day with Paul Maybury and laid the beast to rest.” Joey said during an [SYN interview](https://soundcloud.com/monsebire/interview-with-joe-walker-king) that their original performances of the song went on for an hour and a half, inspired by Krautrock music. Alongside this, during a [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k75v7dw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Stu stated that,while being listed and often performed as one, “Head On/Pill” was originally written as two different songs. In an [interview with Levitation](https://levitation.fm/blogs/news-and-events/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-apf-2014-official-interview) Stu said that it was the first song recorded for *Float Along* and that it was a perfect opener due to its length as the album’s title track would balance the track listing as a closer. The structure of the song was based on a few different cues and largely improvised with the band picking the best take out of a handful of different attempts. In an [interview on 101 Part Time Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7IBZFoDxhk) Stu said “it was the first time we jammed on tape and we allowed ourselves to jam on tape and to be a band — like a live band on record, I suppose… That was the first time we went into a recording extraordinarily loose and something actually kinda half decent came out of it, and I think it just opened up pandora’s box about what music can be. Because that was a song you couldn’t rehearse, it was impossible to rehearse. It just couldn’t be made that way.” It was also the first track by the band to be recorded with two drummers. To quote a [Guitar World interview](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/the-10-best-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-songs-so-far) with Stu “that was actually the first time we used two drum kits in a recording. Cavs [Michael Cavanagh] has always drummed, but when Eric [Moore] joined Gizz, he was playing percussion and theremin and shit. We were always like, ‘we can’t have two drummers, that’s insane’, but eventually it was like, ‘fuck it, we can have two drummers, who cares?’ So ‘Head On/Pill’ was the first song we recorded like that. It just came out of a lot of jams. I think that it will always be one of my favorite things that we’ve done. There was just a spark.” Stu has also [gone on record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuL45bLHEWI) to say that it was a turning point for the band. “We were sort of changing from a two minute, three chord garage rock band to more of an experimental ‘try new things and try new styles’ type band, and that song was really the crux of that. So that was kind of, like, an important little journey in the band’s history.” It was released as a [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23vVIgTMZFU&start=1) on June 18th, 2013 — making it the first track heard from *Float Along — Fill Your Lungs*. On July 1st, the band uploaded a [live video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zek3a86L-Vc) of the themselves recording the song in the studio shot by Syd Row. It was featured as the opening track of *Float Along — Fill Your Lungs* on September 27th, 2013. For Record Store Day in 2014, “Head On/Pill” was released as a [12” single sided picture disc](https://www.discogs.com/release/5640151-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Head-On-Pill) which has since become a sought-after collector’s item. The song was later used in [promotional material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8pJ4zG0-J8) for the band’s 2018 reissues of their earliest albums.

The first known performance was on [2013-02-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-8-2013-pbs-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at PBS Studios in Naarm (Melbourne). Following this, the song was in heavy rotation for 2013, with one performance of the song from [2013-10-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-16-2013-red-bennies-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) even making it onto the third episode of [ABABCd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdcFtitzauw) as a separate second part due to its length and quality. These versions don’t include the sitar found on the original (nor do later versions), but they do include Ambrose playing acoustic guitar, something which rarely occurs within the band. Throughout 2014 to 2016, “Head On/Pill” was commonly performed, though sometimes only the “Pill” segment appeared, like on [2015-09-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-12-2015-the-pour-house-music-hall-raleigh-nc-usa.html). While not as long as the earliest jam sessions, the song was going past the twenty-minute mark at times (see [2016-05-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-25-2016-the-independent-san-francisco-ca-usa.html)) with a majority of the improv taking place in “Pill” like the studio version, though these performances also contained teases of other songs like “Am I In Heaven?” The song was primarily an opener or closer for the sets at the time, setting up its primary spot going forward. Two performances of the song from 2014 were included as part of the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=1477s)*. As five albums worth of new material was being introduced in 2017, “Head On/Pill” became much less frequent — with only one known appearance on [2017-06-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-24-2017-glastonbury-festival-pilton-england-2.html) as part of a secret Glastonbury show. The song appeared as a closer throughout the summer of 2018 with some renditions (such as [2018-06-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-22-2018-stubbs-bar-b-q-austin-tx-usa.html) going a full twenty-six minutes in length. It seemed that as time went on, “Head On/Pill” only grew in size. 2019 showed that this trend of increasing runtimes wasn’t stopping. The song was once again a closer but this time began to run nearly thirty minutes in length, as on [2019-08-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-23-2019-riverside-theater-milwaukee-wi-usa.html). In the film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* the song was included twice as part of [“A Brief History Of Planet Earth.”](https://kglw.net/song/a-brief-history-of-planet-earth?artist_id=1) The segments included were from [2019-10-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-12-2019-columbiahalle-berlin-germany.html) and [2019-10-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-19-2019-razzmatazz-barcelona-spain.html). The song was never played in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic and returned for “Jams Night” on [2021-12-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-20-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html), marking its only 2021 appearance. 2022 saw the song played only a handful of times as a set opener or closer and in 2023 it was played even less. Once the first and only jam, it has fallen out of favor as setlists are consumed by jams of various different types.

I Am Not A Man Unless I Have A Woman
Taking inspiration from soul music, and blending it with the band’s psychedelic analog production, ‘I Am Not A Man Unless I Have A Woman” is a simple and short love song sung between Stu and Ambrose. 


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lg2cpdo1Cmk?si=dTL1AiEeNigBlfrh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


Stu said in an interview for [Moustache Magazine](https://soundcloud.com/moustachemagazine/interview-with-king-gizzard), “It’s not really like, deep from the heart, or anything like that. Ambrose and I just sing it together and Ambrose sings the girl part which we all kind of think is very funny… because he’s sort of the most womanly, androgynous member of the band. With the highest pitched voice, and the skinniest little hot-chick body. I think that was kind of part of it, was to do something where we can make him be a lady. But I don’t know, I think, like, the sentiment of it is pretty simple and straightforward and something a lot of people can probably relate to.” On September 4th, 2013, the song was released as a [single](https://soundcloud.com/flightlessrecords/king-gizz-i-am-not-a-man) — making it the third single for *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)*. The album was released on September 27th, 2013. Vinyl copies of the album give the song a [unique intro](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/videos/687370197942553/) done by PBS DJ [Richie 1250](https://www.instagram.com/richie1250/?hl=en).

These shots are interspersed with [footage](https://vimeo.com/68954792) from photographer [Carbie Warbie](https://www.facebook.com/CarbieWarbie/) of the band playing [“God Is Calling Me Back Home”](https://kglw.net/song/god-is-calling-me-back-home) on [2013-06-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-23-2013-elsternwick-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Elsternwick Park in Naarm (Melbourne). In the Moustache Magazine interview, Stu mentioned that it was the second attempt at a video for the song as the band didn’t like the original cut, saying it “wasn’t right for the song.” He also said that the footage was taken off of an old VHS tape, though it seems that there were actually two or more videos used. Some of the clips were taken from *[Easyriders Video Magazine #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnK3C4TteJU)*.  


The song was only performed a handful of times in August of 2013 during full performances of *Float Along — FIll Your Lungs*. The first known performance was on [2013-08-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-21-2013-bar-open-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Bar Open while the last would be on [2013-08-29](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-29-2013-northcote-social-club-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Northcote Social Club — both in Naarm (Melbourne).
God Is Calling Me Back Home
“God Is Calling Me Back Home” is a dynamic song which starts with quiet acoustics and compressed vocals before exploding into a distorted and high flying second section. The lyrics contrast morbid lines about having to murder certain people seemingly out of boredom with biblical language; its protagonist hears God’s call and drops their hate and ill intent. While most recording dates are not known, the band did vocal overdubs on May 23rd, 2013 based on an [outtake](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10151667205087755) uploaded to their Facebook page. The song was released as part of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* on September 27th, 2013.

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/68954792"></p><div style="text-align: left;">


The earliest performance of the song was on [2013-04-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-19-2013-astor-theatre-perth-wa-australia.html) at the Astor Theatre in Perth. The song would be played throughout 2013 and made appearances during full performances of *Float Along — Fill Your Lungs*. A performance of the song on [2013-06-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-23-2013-elsternwick-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) taped by [Carbie Warbie](https://vimeo.com/68954792) was used in the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fPB4uZ3tcM) for [“I Am Not A Man Unless I Have A Woman.”](https://kglw.net/song/im-not-a-man-unless-i-have-a-woman). The final known performance was by only Stu, Joe and Cavs on [2014-10-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-26-2014-babys-all-right-brooklyn-ny-usa.html) at Baby’s All Right in Brooklyn with a cake and a quick singalong of “Happy Birthday” for Stu. This was shown in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=0s)*.

30 Past 7
“30 Past 7” is a song about waking up and feeling grumpy and mean. Taking heavy influence from ‘60s psychedelic rock and featuring heavy sitar and a bunch of reverb and delay, the song is a dreamlike drone, and one of the band’s most atmospheric and layered.

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7EU7GVjyRA) by Jason Galea (credited to Zonkvision) was released on July 30th, 2013. Featuring Galea’s usual psychedelic visuals, it utilizes footage taken from various VHS tapes (including *[Care Bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_Bears_(TV_series))*) to create a vague dreamlike narrative. The video was put together using [old VHS footage](https://soundcloud.com/leahaphillips/interview-king-gizzard-and-the). [Galea said](https://www.noise11.com/news/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-debut-30-past-7-video-20130731) “I tried to make it feel like it does when you’ve got to wake up at 7:30am and go to a 9 to 5 job… you fall asleep and start dreaming then the snooze goes off.” He also said “the baseball bats scene is kind of like dreaming about fighting your boss… it ends with the person going crazy from the 9 to 5 crunch.” Alongside the video was a [single release](https://soundcloud.com/flightlessrecords/30past7?utm_source=www.imposemagazine.com&utm_campaign=wtshare&utm_medium=widget&utm_content=https%253A%252F%252Fsoundcloud.com%252Fflightlessrecords%252F30past7), making “30 Past 7” the second single from [Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs), which was released on September 27th, 2013.


“30 Past 7” was played a handful of times in 2013 with it’s first reported appearance on [2013-08-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-21-2013-bar-open-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Bar Open in Naarm (Melbourne). The first confirmed appearance was on [2013-08-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-22-2013-goodgod-small-club-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html) at Goodgod Small Club in Eora (Sydney). The song was played almost exclusively during full performances of *Float Along — Fill Your Lungs*, though a performance from [2013-11-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-13-2013-triple-r-performance-space-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) for Triple R Radio was done in a set of *Float Along* and *[Eyes Like The Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)* material. As of writing, this is the only known recorded live version of the song. Based on this show, performances of the song were much more heavy and distorted than the studio version. According to [Reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/10k0ng9/stu_thinking_about_playing_30_past_7_soon/), Stu said before the premiere of the [“Astroturf”](https://kglw.net/song/astroturf) [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql_z7t6WGPg) that he was interested in playing the song in 2023, though this never happened.
Let Me Mend The Past
“Let Me Mend the Past” is a short, emotional song led by Ambrose about a feeling of distance and an urge to set things right. Since its release the song has become a fan favorite, transforming from a rarely played early track to a powerful moment of any show it graces.


Before a performance of the song on [2022-11-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-2-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html), Ambrose told the audience that the song was written about some personal family problems he experienced. “This song's about my mom and her sisters. They all hate each other and I had to live at my grandma's for a bit — or my nan's, sorry. And one of my auntie's put up cameras in the hallway and then my cousin came over and went crazy. I was like ‘everyone just chill, just chill.’ Sometimes you just, you know, can't stop and shit. So, just gonna write a song about it instead.” The song was released on *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* on September 27th, 2013.

The first reported performance was on [2013-08-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-21-2013-bar-open-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Bar Open in Naarm (Melbourne) and would be played a handful of times in August of that year during full performances of *Float Along — Fill Your Lungs*. It would see a few more performances in October and November of that year before disappearing off of sets based on available data. One of these performances from [2013-11-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-13-2013-triple-r-performance-space-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) shows what it may have sounded like at the time, including a gospel-like intro with an extended outro featuring the first known instance of Ambrose rapping on a Gizzard track. The song returned in late 2018 on [2018-11-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-24-2018-the-governor-hindmarsh-hotel-adelaide-sa-australia.html) and became a common song in 2019. A performance of the song from [2019-10-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-18-2019-la-riviera-madrid-spain.html) even made it into the film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. “Let Me Mend The Past” was played twice in 2020 before the COVID-19 lockdown and re-emerged as part of the band’s all acoustic shows starting on [2021-12-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-13-2021-brunswick-ballroom-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). The song returned to the band’s typical sets in 2022 and 2023. The latter had the song carry some emotional weight as it was played as a tribute to Ambrose’s father Broderick Smith, who had passed on April 30th, 2023. The song appeared during the band’s four song set at Smith’s memorial on [2023-05-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-16-2023-theatre-royal-castlemaine-vic-australia-2.html).

Mystery Jack
“Mystery Jack” is a short but dark song about loneliness and death, with a distinctive fuzzy guitar riff and various percussion parts (notably sleigh bells). It was released on *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* on September 27th, 2013.

At live shows “Mystery Jack” has been elusive, appearing after four to five year breaks for a handful of performances before disappearing again. The first known performance was on [2013-04-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-20-2013-the-governor-hindmarsh-hotel-adelaide-sa-australia.html) at The Governor Hindmarsh Hotel in Adelaide. Based on available data, the song wasn’t played again until August for full performances of *Float Along — Fill Your Lungs*, starting with [2013-08-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-21-2013-bar-open-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Bar Open in Naarm (Melbourne). After this run the song seemed to fall off of setlists entirely before appearing five years later on [2018-06-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-21-2018-republic-nola-new-orleans-la-usa.html) at Republic NOLA in New Orleans. The song was played a few more times in 2018, with a performance from [2018-10-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-october-9-2018-c3-stage-guadalajara-mexico.html) appearing in the video *[KING GIZZ vs KEMONITO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw0yFGmB-AE)*. After a few more years of silence, the song returned on [2022-03-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-7-2022-enmore-theatre-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html). After a few rare performances that year, it again disappeared after a Cavs-less performance on [2022-05-31](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-31-2022-gagarin-205-athens-greece.html).

Pop In My Step
“Pop In My Step” is the only Cook Craig-penned track on *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* (released September 27th, 2013) and is a short and carefree song with an upbeat tone and self-assertive lyrics. It was the first Cook-led King Gizzard track to be released.

Float Along — Fill Your Lungs
The band’s first experiment in using 5/4 time signature, the title track of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* has a tranquil yet trippy feel unlike anything else on the album. The lyrics follow someone seeing a certain someone’s face in everyday objects with the choruses exclaiming to take deep breaths. The experiment paved the way for many more non-standard timings and rhythms, such as again using 5/4 in [“The River”](https://kglw.net/song/the-river), 7/4 in *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)*, 9/8 (also Brubeck inspired like “The River”) in *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)*, and the arrays of polymeters in *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)*. Since its debut, the song has become a beloved jam within the band’s catalog, with live versions stretching longer and longer.

The inspiration for the song came to Stu almost subliminally. As said during an interview for [Songwriters on Process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icnno_Qno1I), “I pulled up in my car to the barn and I left my lights on in my car. And my car used to make this — this old Ford that I had at the time — used to make this, like, alarm type sound when you left the lights on. It was like ‘hey, come turn your lights off.’ But it was in 5/4. The alarm itself was in 5/4… It was on for like, hours or something and I think it crept into my brain and it wasn’t until a few days later that I realized that the song I wrote has the exact same rhythm as the car alarm. And it was the first song we wrote that was in not 4/4 or whatever and it fucking blew my mind when I made this, like, connection. I think it was the next time that I accidentally left my lights on and the alarm was going off and I just thought ‘holy shit, that’s that song that we wrote, like, a few days ago.’” In an [interview for Levitation](https://levitation.fm/blogs/news-and-events/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-apf-2014-official-interview), it was mentioned that the song was the album’s closer to balance with “Head On/Pill” as the opener — having two long songs at the album’s front and back. The song would be included on the album of the same name, released September 27th, 2013. Stu later called the track underrated during the band’s *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnqfsy3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

The first reported performance was on [2013-08-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-21-2013-bar-open-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Bar Open in Naarm (Melbourne) with the first confirmed performance a day later on [2013-08-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-22-2013-goodgod-small-club-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html) at the Goodgod Small Club in Eora (Sydney). It originally appeared during full performances of *Float Along — Fill Your Lungs*. These renditions were capable of passing the ten-minute mark, a feature that would remain in future iterations. Based on available data, the song nearly disappeared completely from 2014 to 2018, making only two known appearances. It would return on the band’s 2019 European tour starting with [2019-09-30](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-30-2019-rock-city-nottingham-england.html) at Rock City in Nottingham. Here the song was a set closer that like previous versions went upwards of ten minutes. While not played in 2020, it was played again in 2021 on [2021-12-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-20-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html) for “Jams Night” and returned to sets as a common closer for 2022. As the band fell more and more into jam band territory, the song became longer. 2022 performances reached over fifteen minutes in length (such as [2022-10-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-23-2022-the-anthem-washington-dc-usa.html)), and the same is true of 2023 versions, though they were less common.

Oddments
Alluda Majaka
“Alluda Majaka” is the instrumental opener to the band’s first collection of odds and ends. The song heavily samples the [1995 Tollywood film of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluda_Majaka), with its intro being taken from the movie’s opening action scene (around eight minutes and thirty seconds in). In the [liner notes](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/oddments) for the 2018 reissue of *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)*, Stu said 
“‘Alluda Majaka’ was a way to test out a new synthesizer I had bought.” It saw a release as part of *Oddments* on March 7th, 2014.

While “Alluda Majaka” was never played live, Lucas said that it might be an interesting song to try and play live in Gizzard’s [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6kvo4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).
Stressin’
Focusing on its narrator’s anxiety, “Stressin’” is a calm track appearing early in *[Oddments’](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)* runtime. [According to the liner notes](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/oddments), “Stressin’” (as well as [“Work This Time”](https://kglw.net/song/work-this-time)) were attempts by Joey and Stu to write “soulful music.” It was released on March 7th, 2014.

The first known performance of the song was on [2014-10-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-26-2014-babys-all-right-brooklyn-ny-usa.html) at Baby’s All Right in Brooklyn as part of Panache CMJ Day Party & Hangover Brunch. It was played by a three piece team of Stu, Joey and Cavs, and carries the album’s laid back tone, though in a different key signature. The song made a few appearances in 2015, seemingly as a solo encore for Stu. Based on available data, “Stressin’” was played once in 2016, yet again as an encore, and a performance of the song can be found in the band’s documentary from that year *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=3102s)*. The entire band played the track a few times in 2018 but started to play it more in 2019. While it didn’t appear in 2020, the song would be reinvented for the band’s fully acoustic sets in 2021 with a rare few performances in 2022.

Vegemite
“Vegemite” is an ode to the food of the same name, a song about “...eating Vegemite on toast with your girlfriend!” (according to an [interview with NME](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=910146975664873&set=a.173717175974527)). While the song starts and ends with loud drums, it’s a short, upbeat and strange ballad about an Australian breakfast favorite. It’s also the closest thing to a novelty song within the King Gizzard canon, with a presentation that would fit well on the Dr. Demento Radio Show. Since its release, the song has become a meme within the weirdo swarm with countless [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9oWFGPkfB4) and [parodies](https://kinggizzardandtheshitpostwizard.bandcamp.com/track/christmas-lights) circulating online, though the band themselves have largely stayed away from the track.

While showing how to play the song for the [Bad Bonn Song Book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG07PpuP16Q), Stu said it was one of the easiest songs he ever wrote while also stating his own opinion on the food. “It’s a song about vegemite which is an Australian spread you put on toast. Everyone who’s from anywhere but Australia hates it and thinks that it tastes disgusting. I think it's pretty sweet.” This opinion is not shared by the rest of the band as during a show at Baby’s All Right on [2014-10-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-26-2014-babys-all-right-brooklyn-ny-usa.html), Joey said “It’s a yeast extract that’s derived from vegetables. Tastes like human shit and everyday Australians eat it for breakfast.” When the song was released as a single, [Stu described](https://acrosstheocean.com.au/news/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-announce-new-album-oddments) a bit of history regarding the tune. “I recorded ‘Vegemite’ at my parents house in Anglesea on their out-of-tune-but-exactly-a-half-step-down piano. It’s probably the most literal song I’ve ever written. I love vegemite…”. In the [liner notes for the 2018 reissue](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/oddments) of *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)* Stu explained what every song on the album was, though was vague on this track in particular. “‘Vegemite’ is just ‘Vegemite.’” That said, Joey gave some interesting insight during his appearance on [Office Hours Live with Tim Heidecker](https://youtu.be/4koSNtnfRqw?si=HTn5tzFI8PmeAea0&t=2282). In it, he said the song was a “weak attempt at trying to get a sync on an ad” — meaning that it may have been their shot at writing advertising jingles. This commercial-oriented approach to songwriting didn’t seem to be lost on Stu, who told the audience to envision a child-friendly vegemite ad during the previously mentioned Baby’s All Right show.

After a [tease](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=745830292096543&set=a.173717175974527) on January 8th, a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Inr7FKKWLI) by Jason Galea was released on January 13th, 2014. It  features Stu eating toast with vegemite. Stu’s face is overlaid on the vegemite itself akin to [The Annoying Orange](https://www.youtube.com/@AnnoyingOrange). As the video goes on, Stu eats the toast while singing and playing the song. “Vegemite” was the [only single](https://acrosstheocean.com.au/news/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-announce-new-album-oddments) for *Oddments*, which would see a release on March 7th, 2014.

The first known performance of the song was on [2014-10-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-26-2014-babys-all-right-brooklyn-ny-usa.html) at Baby’s All Right in Brooklyn during their “Panache CMJ Day Party & Hangover Brunch.” [The existing recording](https://archive.org/details/kglw2014-10-26.multitrack.flac/KingGizzard2014-10-26_nyctaper_t05.flac) showcases an electric version of the song played by Stu, Joey and Cavs with gritty distortion and Joey providing backing vocals to the track. At the end of the performance, Stu says “I’m really sorry everyone after listening to that. Everyone just got twenty percent dumber after that.” On [2014-12-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-13-2014-rosemount-hotel-perth-wa-australia.html) the song would be performed by the entire band with Ambrose adding backing vocals alongside Joey, as well as some harmonica accompaniment. Perhaps the strangest performance of the song was for a [school project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuL45bLHEWI) which was later uploaded to YouTube in 2022. Stu played an acoustic rendition of the song while on a porch in late 2014. In 2015 and 2016 the song would shift again with Stu playing the song as a solo encore. The last known performance would be on [2016-05-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-14-2016-babys-all-right-brooklyn-ny-usa-2.html).

Following 2016, the band largely distanced themselves from the song, if not outwardly stated their displeasure with the tune. During the band’s *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnr67bo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Cavs named the song his least favorite in the band’s entire discography. Joey also [joked](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnqvjbe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about it when talking about trying to write genuine music. During their gig at the Mr. Smalls Theatre in Millvale on [2022-05-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-22-2022-mr-smalls-theatre-millvale-pa-usa.html), [Stu jokingly said](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/14genbr/the_52222_incident/) that they were about to play the song to a loud audience reaction before taking it back, leading to Joey laughing at the fans. Before the final song of the night, fans began to chant “Vegemite” which prompted Joey to say “no one wants to hear that fuckin’ song.” Stu responded by claiming that the extract was a “myth.” During Joey and Lucas’s appearance on [Office Hours Live with Tim Heidecker](https://youtu.be/4koSNtnfRqw?si=HTn5tzFI8PmeAea0&t=2282), Joey responded to a fan asking for the song by saying “you know that’s never gonna happen.” When asked if the band would ever revisit the song during their [2023 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k75i1ks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Ambrose jokingly responded “Vegemite metal version coming soon.”
It’s Got Old
“It’s Got Old” is a mid-tempo jam about a rocky relationship with some standout harmonica work from Ambrose. It’s an oldie too. Before it was ever played as part of Gizzard, Stu played the track by himself at The Tote Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) on [2012-07-17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=411iRPyBBS8). At the time, the lyrics and song structure were already complete. This makes it the earliest known song from *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)* to be played live. In the [liner notes the 2018 reissue](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/oddments), Stu wrote “we tried ‘It's Got Old’ for *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* and *[Float Along](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* before the 3rd and final recording worked.” According to an [early tracklisting](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/rtlc4d/so_i_was_doing_some_looking_around_for_the/) for *Oddments* in December of 2013, the song’s file was called “its got old (with harp)” — implying that Ambrose’s harmonica part was added on at a later date than the rest of the track. It was released as the fourth track on *Oddments* on March 7th, 2014.

The first reported live appearance as part of Gizzard was on [2014-10-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-october-24-2014-brandeis-university-waltham-ma-usa.html) at Brandeis University in Waltham. The song seemed to only be played a few times in 2014 and 2015 before being dropped off of sets. The 2016 documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=3838s)* features the Brandeis University performance.  In 2021 the band began to perform all acoustic shows and included “It’s Got Old” on three of these setlists.This version of the song would become the go-to for the band in the following years, though [2023-03-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-18-2023-schlachthof-wiesbaden-wiesbaden-germany.html) features an energetic electric version with a wah-wah-heavy outro.

Work This Time
When you think of King Gizzard classics, you might think of songs from *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* or *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)*, tracks that have been played religiously throughout the years and have music videos, posters, etc. However if you look at Spotify statistics you might find an unexpected track in the top ranking songs. I’m talking about “Work This Time,” a slow, introspective Joey-led track from *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)* about an uncertain relationship. The reason for its popularity isn’t all too special — it was featured prominently on Spotify’s [“Modern Psychedelia”](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX8gDIpdqp1XJ) playlist, but for what was an obscure song from an often overlooked release, it’s very impressive. Since the song’s surge in popularity, the band has transformed it into a beast on stage with Joey at the center, and the track has become an essential piece from the band’s earliest days. From obscure gem to bonafide classic, “Work This Time” saw what is possibly the biggest leap in significance for any Gizzard song.


[According to the liner notes]](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/oddments) for the 2018 reissue of *Oddments*, “Work This Time” (as well as [“Stressin’”](https://kglw.net/song/stressin)) were attempts by Joey and Stu to write “soulful music.” It’s the first song in the band’s discography to feature vocals from Joey alone. It was released on March 7th, 2014.

While teased as far back as [2016-03-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-2-2016-ancienne-belgique-brussels-belgium.html), the first known performance of “Work This Time” was on [2018-11-29](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-november-29-2018-the-tivoli-brisbane-australia.html) at The Tivoli in Brisbane and would be pretty close to the studio version, with a short solo during the outro. In 2019 the song would be brought back after being featured on the Spotify playlist. While the first few performances didn’t stray far from *Oddments*, around [2019-08-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-18-2019-paramount-theatre-seattle-wa-usa-2.html) the song was given a twist with Joey busting out an extended guitar solo during the outro. This would turn into a tradition with the following versions featuring a spotlight on Joey’s guitar playing. “Work This Time” would continue to be a part of the band’s repertoire in the following years, including in 2020 and 2021 around the time of the COVID-19 lockdown. By 2023 the band begun to expand the solos into new territory with different tempos, time signatures and even song transitions (see [2023-09-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-2-2023-manchester-academy-manchester-england.html) and [2024-03-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-14-2024-teatro-coliseo-santiago-chile.html)).

ABABCD
One of the shortest songs King Gizzard has ever released, “ABABCD” (also stylized as Ababcd.”) is Joey’s theme song for the show of the same name](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/oddments) and touts how the program will blow your mind. *[ABABCd.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10720328/)* was created by Banalrama Studios and consists of twenty-minute episodes with four to six different musical acts playing their songs on specially designed sets. [The title refers to song structure](https://www.redbull.com/au-en/ababcd). King Gizzard appeared on the show for the third episode with a performance of [“The Raid”](https://kglw.net/song/the-raid) shot on [2013-10-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-16-2013-red-bennies-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Red Bennies in Naarm (Melbourne). Banalrama would then release a second video (labeled “episode three — part two”) featuring a performance of [“Head On/Pill”](https://kglw.net/song/head-on-pill?artist_id=1) from that same concert. [Host Nick Clarke would state](https://www.vice.com/en/article/695mjd/ababcd-is-for-those-unsure-whether-to-go-to-a-gig-or-watch-tv) in 2016 that their performance was one of his favorites from the show. 
There are actually two different mixes of the song. [The version heard in the intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9JmqTufJ9s) of the show features louder screeching guitar, while the studio version lowers the volume. A great way to hear this is by focusing on the left channel. The song was officially released on March 7th, 2014 as part of *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)*.


“ABABCD” has not been played live.

Sleepwalker
One of the band’s many songs about sleeping, “Sleepwalker” is a fun and straightforward song from *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)* with some noticeably analogue production featuring channels cutting out half way through. The simple strumming pattern paired with its easy going attitude creates one of the lightest moments on the album and in the band’s discography as a whole.


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yAVqiJyK6L4?si=63-rs2zn_KLSz4c7&amp;start=2344" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


The song’s origins start back around 2011 at the time of *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)*. [According to Stu](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/oddments), “Sleepwalker” was written for the EP but for whatever reason was cut and later reworked into the *Oddments* version. A demo for the song was released on *[Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2)*, which lines up with other demos from the *Willoughby’s Beach* era with its DIY production and drum machine (see the demo for [“Let It Bleed”](https://kglw.net/song/let-it-bleed?artist_id=1) on the same compilation for a good example). While the demo contains the iconic vocal melodies from Stu, its lyrics are hard to make out but definitely different from the studio version. We believe the unused lyrics are “Was that why you’re in the room,” “find my baby a bottle of water,” “I’ve got a feeling why our bed broke” and “you’re already feeling better.” It also features a solo while excluding verses and any breaks. According to an early *Oddments* track listing from December of 2013, the song had the title “Who? He (Sleepwalker).” It was released on *Oddments* on March 7th, 2014.

The earliest known appearance of “Sleepwalker” on stage was on [2014-03-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-27-2014-the-tote-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), making it one of the earliest songs from *Oddments* to be played live. It was played pretty reliably throughout 2014 even making an acoustic appearance on [2014-05-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-2-2014-carson-creek-ranch-austin-tx-usa.html) at the band’s first show in America. It would be played twice that day, one time as an electronic version in the main set, another time as an [acoustic rendition between Stu and Joey](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-2-2014-carson-creek-ranch-austin-tx-usa-2.html). While it would also appear in 2015 and 2016, it would seem to be less frequent than 2014. In 2021 the song was awoken from its slumber for the band’s acoustic shows where it would remain a popular choice. Starting on [2022-03-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Return of the Curse of Timeland festival, the electric version would return and remained the dominant version of the song in setlists. Here the song became an occasional target for jams, with shows like [2022-04-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-17-2022-event-lawn-at-virgin-hotels-las-vegas-las-vegas-nv-usa.html) and [2023-03-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-9-2023-den-gra-hal-copenhagen-denmark.html) showing the song as a destination out of another song. While the band had entered jam band territory by this point, “Sleepwalker” never went over six minutes at most.

Hot Wax
“Hot Wax” is a simple piece of psychedelic garage rock with strange production and a distinct rhythm section. The lyrics are repetitive and establish a strange fascination of Stu’s with sludgy engulfing liquids.

In the [liner notes](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/oddments) of the 2018 reissue of *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)*, Stu described “Hot Wax” as “a home recording Ambrose and I made.” The rattling, metallic sound heard throughout the track is a [spring reverb guitar pedal being hit by Stu](https://www.audiotechnology.com/features/king-gizzards-lo-fi-gut-feeling). “I do have one of those big yellow Danelectro Spring King pedals, which can be pretty cool as a studio tool. That’s that sound on ‘Hot Wax’ that keeps coming in, I was just punching one of those.” The song features lyrics lifted from The Beach Boys’ 1962 song [“Surfin’ Safari”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfin%27_Safari_(song)) during its choruses. It was released on March 7th, 2014 and later referenced by the band a handful of times, often for new vinyl pressings. For the 2018 reissue of *Oddments*, the song was used in [promotional videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8pJ4zG0-J8). A tweet showing off the Australian vinyl pressings of *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)* features the phrase with emojis of a pair of eyes, a candle and fire.](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1333603320993173504?s=20). In *[Gizz with the program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hll9ZcWJeZM)*, while the band spectates the pressing of *[Butterfly 3000](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)*, Cavs brings up the song with Ambrose mimicking the rhythm afterwards.

A [music video](https://youtu.be/s8azlP-FgHs?si=VvhQIIFhAi-Ubwax) for the song was released on May 30th, 2014 on NME’s YouTube channel. Created by Jason Galea, it shows Stu, Joey and Cavs playing the song with 2D animation depicting different elements of the *Oddments* album cover and surreal video effects. [In a 2016 interview Galea stated that the video was edited in After Effects with animation done frame by frame in Photoshop](https://nofilmschool.com/2016/auteurs-music-video-jason-galea). The song was [nominated](https://web.archive.org/web/20151226062336/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jawards/14/video/hot-wax.htm) for Music Video of the Year at the 2014 J Awards and would be referenced by Galea in the future, such as on the poster for [2019-08-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-20-2019-the-depot-salt-lake-city-ut-usa.html).

Its first reported live performance was on [2014-03-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-26-2014-the-old-bar-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at The Old Bar in Naarm (Melbourne) and would be played throughout 2014. These versions are more chaotic than the studio version with a noticeably faster pace, a sped up ending, a different key and Stu singing through a filter which lowers his voice. The song continued to make appearances throughout 2015 and 2016 with no notable differences from the 2014 rendition. After an appearance at Baby’s All Right in Brooklyn on [2016-05-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-14-2016-babys-all-right-brooklyn-ny-usa-2.html), “Hot Wax” seemed to disappear from sets apart from an appearance in the band’s documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=3102s)*. The song reappeared briefly on [2018-06-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-14-2016-babys-all-right-brooklyn-ny-usa-2.html) at the Variety Playhouse in Atlanta coming out of [“Digital Black”](https://kglw.net/song/digital-black?artist_id=1) — this time without the voice changer. It was brought back to the stage on [2022-03-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) as part of the Return of the Curse of Timeland festival. From here “Hot Wax” entered the band’s rotation again as a semi-rare track with a few performances in 2022 and 2023.

Crying
With its distinct riff and Lou Reed-esque monologue, “Crying” is the start of a two song combo appearing towards the end of *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)*. The song is about a broken relationship with its narrator seemingly trying to move on, warning the girl he was once with that she’s destined to break another heart.


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkOK1rNg6KM?si=-FiQ9Sod7R86QCxp&amp;start=172" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


“Crying” is the oldest song to appear on the album. According to Stu in the [liner notes](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/oddments) from the 2018 reissue of *Oddments*, “Cooky wrote ‘Crying’ when he was 16 and the two of us used to play it in our old band.” That band was [Revolver & Sun](https://kglw.net/page/associated-music), a rock band composed of Stu Mackenzie, Cook Craig, Fraser A. Gorman and Monty Harnett, which took inspiration from the Beatles and the 13th Floor Elevators. While a majority of the band’s songs are now long gone, a demo for “Crying” uploaded on May 15th, 2009 was found on [their triple J Unearthed page](https://www.abc.net.au/triplejunearthed/artist/revolver-sun/). This version has a faster pace but contains the structure and lyrics of the Gizzard rendition. While the song wouldn’t be released until *Oddments*, its title was [put on the back of an early DIY shirt](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=503265929686315&set=a.503265679686340) from the band in 2012. The person modeling it is Monty Harnett, who would reprise his role on drums for the *Oddments* recording of “Crying” as one of the very few people outside the band to play on a King Gizzard track. An [early version](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/photos/pb.100044289166773.-2207520000/733067783372794/?type=3) of the track list shows the song at a total of four minutes and eighteen seconds. While this version may include [“Pipe-Dream”](https://kglw.net/song/pipe-dream?artist_id=1) as part of it, adding the track lengths only gets us to three minutes and fifty seven seconds. It’s unclear what the remaining seconds are. “Crying” was released on March 7th, 2014.


As of writing “Crying” has only had one confirmed appearance, that being on [2014-06-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-14-2014-warsaw-brooklyn-ny-usa-2.html) at Warsaw in Brooklyn while opening for The Dead Milkmen. This performance would appear in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=3102s)*. There have been two other reported appearances, but no supporting documentation.
Pipe-Dream
Coming out of [“Crying”](https://kglw.net/song/crying?artist_id=1) is a short instrumental with a title alluding to Cook’s solo project [Pipe-Eye](https://kglw.net/page/associated-music). Monty Harnett, who was the drummer in the band Revolver & Sun with both Stu and Cook, played drums on the track. It was released on March 7th, 2014 on *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments).*


“Pipe-Dream” has never been played live.
Homeless Man In Adidas
Described by Stu as an [attempt to write “quiet music”](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/oddments) in the liner notes of the 2018 reissue of *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)*, “Homeless Man In Adidas” is an acoustic ballad with soft drumming and the sound of rain. The lyrics portray a homeless man who finds comfort in the city and ocean.
The song is very likely inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dSCEPXaTAQ) blues jam with [Revolver and Sun](https://kglw.net/page/associated-music). It was released on March 7th, 2014 as the penultimate track on *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments).* 


“Homeless Man In Adidas” has not been played live. 
Oddments
“Oddments” is one of the shortest songs the band has ever released, at a total of twenty-five seconds, and acts as the theme song for the [album of the same name](https://kglw.net/page/associated-music). [According to Stu](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/oddments), the name came from trips to the store. “We used to go to the local grocery store and pick up what was labeled as an oddment. This was to my understanding at the time, a delicious can of soda left over from a larger pack sold at a discounted rate. We were poor thirsty young men looking for a bargain and this sugar kick fuelled the record. It also fittingly described the nature of the songs. Leftovers, potpourri, a bubble and squeak of a record.” It was released on March 7th, 2014 and featured in [promotional material](https://www.instagram.com/p/BniH4uQHzL5/) for the 2018 reissue of *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)*. 


“Oddments” has never been played live.
Gripless 12” EP
Nothing Left To Hide (King Gizzard Remix)
This is no doubt one of the most obscure King Gizzard tracks in the band’s entire history. Part of Dorsal Fins’ debut release, the *[Gripless 12” EP](https://kglw.net/discography/gripless)*, “Nothing Left To Hide” is exactly what its title suggests: a remix of the Dorsal Fins song “Nothing Left To Hide.” Starting the second side of the EP, Gizzard’s take on the song is abstract, with a bunch of stuttering loops, strange mechanical whirring sounds and high pitch static. Halfway through a slow beat begins with guitars soaked in reverb (reminiscent of some *[Eyes Like The Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)* guitar parts) as the stuttering continues. It ends with the entire track being filtered through tremolo. The track’s [Bandcamp page](https://dorsalfins.bandcamp.com/track/nothing-left-to-hide-king-gizzard-remix) specifically credits Joey and Stu for the creation of the remix, while the EP itself credits Joey and Stu alongside “the King Gizz Crew.” The song was released on April 3rd, 2014 and has never been played live.


Fun fact: the EP’s cover was made by Jason Galea.
I’m In Your Mind Fuzz
I’m In Your Mind
*[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)* is one of the essential Gizzard albums and often one of the first recommendations for those looking to get into the band. Its analogue production paired with its psychedelic garage sound makes an accessible listening experience for those not already adjusted to the genre. However a key thing about the album is that it starts with a bang, opening with a four-song suite ([described](https://levitation.fm/blogs/news-and-events/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-apf-2014-official-interview) as a “song cycle”) of “I’m In Your Mind” > [“I’m Not In Your Mind”](https://kglw.net/song/im-not-in-your-mind?artist_id=1) > [“Cellophane”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane?artist_id=1) > [“I’m In Your Mind Fuzz.”](https://kglw.net/song/im-in-your-mind-fuzz?artist_id=1) The first in the lineup is a perfect introduction to what *Mind Fuzz* will elaborate on: a motorik beat accompanied by a killer bass part, distorted guitars and blaring harmonica. The lyrics are psychedelic, but driven partially by paranoia about how everyone is “sucking on fluoride” — a reference to the [conspiracy theory](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nidhisubbaraman/fluoride-water-iq-kids-debate) that governments put fluoride in the water to control the minds of the population, satirized in Stanley Kubrick’s film *[Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67wKhddWu4)*. [Stu said so himself](https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-enter-your-mind-fuzz). “It’s a weird imagination thing. It doesn’t really mean anything specific. It’s tongue-in-cheek, a reference to all the reptilian and alien conspiracy shit that people talk about, and how people shouldn’t put fluoride in their water and all this mind control crap. It’s meant to be, ‘I’m in your mind.’ But your mind can get fuzzy. I guess it was meant to mean that ‘I’m in your mind fuzz, I’m somewhere in there, and I’m controlling your brain.’ It’s sort of silly.”

Out of everything in the suite, the idea for “I’m In Your Mind” came first, [according to Stu](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/the-10-best-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-songs-so-far). “Of the four tracks of that suite, [‘Cellophane’] was the last one to come together. ‘The I’m In Your Mind’ thing was first, and it did really feel like it needed to go to some other place. The song just needed to go somewhere else and then come back.” The song debuted on [2014-02-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-9-2014-st-kilda-foreshore-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at St Kilda Foreshore in Naarm (Melbourne) alongside other *Mind Fuzz* material under the working title “Bit.” The ending of the suite, “I’m In Your Mind Fuzz,” was labeled as the same, meaning they were once considered the same song instead of two variations with different titles. Just like the album, it was part of a four-song suite. These early versions of the song were nearly identical to finished studio renditions in terms of composition but featured different lyrics. We’ve tried to transcribe the lyrics from the band’s first American show on [2014-05-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-2-2014-carson-creek-ranch-austin-tx-usa.html) to give an example: “You are only lazy ‘cause you're tired. You took us in, please look into your eye. And everybody’s lazy when they're fried. Just *unintelligible* in your mind.” The early version relies less on the fluoride conspiracy element and instead goes for a way more psychedelic approach. Later in the year, the song’s finalized lyrics would be put in place. The song was recorded by Wayne Gordon at Daptone Records in Brooklyn and mixed by Michael Badger and Stu Mackenzie. Footage of the song being recorded appeared in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=458s)* as well as on [Joey’s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/iKv80bsfPO/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D). The song would be part of *I’m In Your Mind Fuzz*, released on October 31st, 2014. The bassline of the suite would later reappear in [“The Lord of Lightning.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-lord-of-lightning?artist_id=1)

“I’m In Your Mind,” and by extension the rest of the suite, was a set staple from 2014 to 2016, even making it into the concert film for *[Live In San Francisco ‘16](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-san-francisco-16)*, but that changed in 2017. “Cellophane” would separate  to join “The Lord of Lightning”, leaving the rest of the songs on their own. It was played once in 2017 on [2017-01-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-january-21-2017-the-meadow-singapore-singapore.html) at The Meadow in Singapore as part of a three song run of “I’m In Your Mind” > “I’m Not In Your Mind” > “Cellophane.” It was then picked up again in 2018. While often teased at the end of “Cellophane” in August, the song would rejoin “I’m Not In Your Mind” before heading into [“The Balrog.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-balrog?artist_id=1) One of these performances from [2018-08-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-25-2018-domaine-national-de-saint-cloud-saint-cloud-france.html) would end up in *[THE NONAGON MOVIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV8knE56GE4&pp=ygUNbm9uYWdvbiBtb3ZpZQ%3D%3D)*. This would continue going into 2019 but would also fade away starting in August as the Mind Fuzz suite was picked up yet again. While not always complete, this would be the form the song would take going forward. In 2020 and 2021 the song was only played four times but since then has been seen as part of the Mind Fuzz suite at various shows.

I’m Not In Your Mind
The second part of the Mind Fuzz suite ([described](https://levitation.fm/blogs/news-and-events/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-apf-2014-official-interview) as a “song cycle”), “I’m Not In Your Mind” is a psychedelic instrumental with a fast pace and mind-bending riffs which ties together [“I’m In Your Mind”](https://kglw.net/song/im-in-your-mind?artist_id=1) and [“Cellophane.”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane?artist_id=1) The song also plays around with the [“Arabian riff,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_riff) also known as “The Streets of Cairo,” which has roots going all the way back to the 1700s. While not always played at live shows, “I’m Not In Your Mind” is the album’s wonkiness and Krautrock influence condensed into a short segue. 


The earliest known performance of the song was on [2014-02-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-9-2014-st-kilda-foreshore-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at St. Kilda Foreshore in Naarm (Melbourne). The setlist indicates that there was a song named “Math” which may be the working title of the song, the following song “Cellophane” or a version where “Cellophane” was included as part of the track. Just like the album, it was part of a four-song suite of “I’m In Your Mind” > “I’m Not In Your Mind” > “Cellophane” > [“I’m In Your Mind Fuzz.”](https://kglw.net/song/im-in-your-mind-fuzz?artist_id=1) Based on existing recordings of the song from early-mid 2014, it was no different than the studio version. The song was recorded by Paul Maybury at A Secret Location in Melbourne and co-mixed by Stu. The song would be part of *[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)*, released on October 31st, 2014. The bassline of the suite would later reappear at the end of [“The Lord of Lightning.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-lord-of-lightning?artist_id=1)

“I’m Not In Your Mind” was consistently played at shows from 2014 to 2016 as part of the suite, with footage making its way into the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=458s)*. The song would also be a prominent part of the band’s concert film for *[Live In San Francisco ‘16](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-san-francisco-16)*. “I’m Not In Your Mind” was a given for the band’s setlists before disappearing in 2017 as “Cellophane” was moved to be a part of other suites. To our knowledge it was played only once that year on [2017-01-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-january-21-2017-the-meadow-singapore-singapore.html) at The Meadow in Singapore. In August of 2018 the song was paired with “I’m In Your Mind” to go into [“The Balrog.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-balrog?artist_id=1) One of these performances from [2018-08-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-25-2018-domaine-national-de-saint-cloud-saint-cloud-france.html) would end up in *[THE NONAGON MOVIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV8knE56GE4)*. This pairing lasted into 2019, the same year the Mind Fuzz suite was reintroduced. It would sometimes not include “I’m In Your Mind Fuzz”, but at this point “I’m Not In Your Mind” had found its home again. In 2020 it would make three appearances (as well as appearing in the documentary [RATTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AzPaId5Qc&pp=ygUScmF0dHkga2luZyBnaXp6YXJk)) then only two times in 2021. Since then the song has made occasional appearances as part of the Mind Fuzz suite, though by 2022 it was becoming a longer jam with more improvisation involved compared to older versions. Check out [2023-03-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-20-2023-cirque-royalkoninklijk-circus-brussels-belgium.html) in Brussels for an interesting example.

Cellophane
One of the biggest songs on *[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)* was its leading single, “Cellophane.” While the song was released to show off what *Mind Fuzz* could be, it seems to have taken the band by surprise. [Stu said](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/the-10-best-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-songs-so-far) "’Cellophane’ is a segue — a section — and it’s awesome that people have latched onto it, because we didn’t really think of it as a song. It’s always surprising to us the things that people dig!” The song’s fuzz guitars, motorik drum beat and catchy bassline created an early hit for the band that has continued to be played to this day.

[According to Stu](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/the-10-best-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-songs-so-far), “Cellophane” was the last song of the suite to be completed. “Of the four tracks of that suite, this was the last one to come together. The [‘I’m In Your Mind’](https://kglw.net/song/im-in-your-mind?artist_id=1) thing was first, and it did really feel like it needed to go to some other place. The song just needed to go somewhere else and then come back.” The earliest known performance of the song was on [2014-02-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-9-2014-st-kilda-foreshore-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at St Kilda Foreshore in Naarm (Melbourne). The setlist indicates that there was a song named “Math” which may have referred to this song, “I’m Not In Your Mind” or a combination of the two. Just like the album, it was part of a four song suite of “I’m In Your Mind” > [“I’m Not In Your Mind”](https://kglw.net/song/im-not-in-your-mind?artist_id=1) > “Cellophane” > [“I’m In Your Mind Fuzz.”](https://kglw.net/song/im-in-your-mind-fuzz?artist_id=1) The song was recorded by Wayne Gordon at Daptone Records in Brooklyn and mixed by Michael Badger and Stu. “Cellophane” would be included on *I’m In Your Mind Fuzz*, released on October 31st, 2014.

The track would become a [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U68lcZygXlo) on September 4th, 2014 and was given a Jason Galea [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qwdxKkmhoc) on the 15th. The video, utilizing anaglyph 3D, starts with Stu watching TV.. He switches to a channel playing psychedelic colors with the rest of the band performing in red robes with gold jewelry, while the drum kits are covered in red fabric. He is then magically given a pair of 3D glasses and sucked into the screen to play the song before being thrown out of the TV into a park at the very end. The video description has a [link to a Mediafire folder](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/w3iy7m2mpo9bp/CELLOPHANE) that contains a high quality version of the video as well as a .zip file containing the single with the B-side of the band’s rarity [“The Wholly Ghost.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-wholly-ghost?artist_id=1) This single would later be issued as a [7” single](https://www.discogs.com/release/6317602-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Cellophane) with additional 3D glasses, which have since become highly sought after collectibles. In 2014, [Stu talked about the creation of the video](https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-enter-your-mind-fuzz). “That song kind of references 3D movies and it’s sort of a silly song, it’s light-hearted, so we thought we’d do something that suited it. It’s mostly his idea – he’s done some 3D stuff in the past, but it’s a total collaboration and he’s the brain. He’s the talented one.” In 2016 [Galea stated](https://nofilmschool.com/2016/auteurs-music-video-jason-galea) the inspiration for the video. “The 3D glasses idea came from the lyrics of the song about watching 3D movies with cellophane glasses. The 3D idea didn't happen straight away, but after trying this 3D stereo effect, it gave an interesting effect, which looked good to me with or without glasses on.” As for the robes, he explained: I’ve been using robes and cultish looks in my videos for a while now. The ideas were present in the *Mind Fuzz* album artwork, which I thought could be cool to cross over to the video. *Mind Fuzz* was the first album where the '70s prog and heavier sounds started appearing, which goes hand-in-hand with fantasy imagery like wizards, occult, etc.” He would also express disappointment with YouTube as it compressed the video. “The intensity in video form is hard to match when YouTube compresses the video. I think I could go way further than what I do with intensity, but have to hold back because their bitrate settings wreck anything that’s over-the-top fast, strobe-y, or detailed. The Cellophane video turned out really compressed; hopefully, over time, they’ll give more options for the uploader. Seeing video presented in a gallery or as projections at a show is a much better experience.“ A [“de-Anaglyphic” version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WpXM4LQUCA) of the video was later released on May 27th, 2022. In a [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i89q8fk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that same month Stu named the video as one of the most fun to make. The video would be referenced on the poster for [2019-07-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-5-2019-unsw-roundhouse-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html) as well as the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daz_doXNAB4) for [“Black Hot Soup.”](https://kglw.net/song/black-hot-soup?artist_id=1)

Throughout the years the song has been played on and off. The song was played as part of the Mind Fuzz suite extensively throughout 2014 and 2015, with prominent appearances (such as the band’s first KEXP session on [2015-09-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-september-2-2015-kexp-studios-seattle-wa-usa.html)) but would start to change position in 2016. While the suite was played (including in the concert film for *[Live At San Francisco ‘16](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-san-francisco-16)* and *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=458s)*, the band began to introduce the *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* track [“The Balrog”](https://kglw.net/song/the-balrog?artist_id=1) that year. On the album the song is led into with the suite’s bass line and in a live setting it was no different. Now it was possible for “Cellophane” to transition into “The Balrog” or stranger yet, for it to be skipped altogether coming out of “I’m Not In Your Mind,” as seen on [2016-07-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-july-8-2016-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html). Later in the year the song would begin to transition into “Alter Me II,” such as on [2016-12-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-december-9-2016-meredith-supernatural-amphitheatre-meredith-australia.html). In 2017 the suite was scrapped but “Cellophane” was not, with it often appearing coming out of [“The Lord of Lightning”](https://kglw.net/song/the-lord-of-lightning?artist_id=1) near the end of sets. While the song would sometimes then lead to “The Balrog,” ([2017-03-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-18-2017-the-night-cat-melbourne-australia.html)) it was often the end of the sequence. This led to it being the final song of a massive opening medley heard at the end of the year: [“Some Context”](https://kglw.net/song/some-context?artist_id=1) > [“Welcome to an Altered Future”](https://kglw.net/song/welcome-to-an-altered-future?artist_id=1) > [“Digital Black”](https://kglw.net/song/digital-black?artist_id=1) > [“Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg”](https://kglw.net/song/han-tyumi-the-confused-cyborg?artist_id=1) > “The Lord of Lightning” > “Cellophane.” It would occasionally go into “I’m In Your Mind Fuzz” but this was rare ([2017-11-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-november-18-2017-the-marquee-rna-showgrounds-brisbane-australia.html)). This lasted going into 2018 but would begin to be phased out in August with the band opting for “Digital Black” > [“Vomit Coffin”](https://kglw.net/song/vomit-coffin?artist_id=1) (shortened) > “The Lord of Lightning” > “Cellophane.” The song would also be cut out of the medley entirely at some shows, such as [2018-06-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-7-2018-monks-bar-missoula-mt-usa.html) where the band chooses to replace the song with [“Altered Beast I,”](https://kglw.net/song/altered-beast-i?artist_id=1) or in the case of [2018-08-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-22-2018-manufaktur-schorndorf-germany.html), nothing at all. The age of “Cellophane” as an independent piece from the suite was over. On [2019-08-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-14-2019-svn-west-san-francisco-ca-usa.html) at SVN West in San Francisco, the song would return to the Mind Fuzz suite where it would remain throughout the year though some performances would cut out “I’m In Your Mind Fuzz.” The song would be played at two 2020 shows and stuck with the band as part of the Mind Fuzz suite moving forward (though there may be exceptions such as with [2024-03-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-21-2024-parque-simon-bolivar-bogota-colombia.html), the first “The Lord of Lightning” x “Cellophane” pairing since [2018-10-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-13-2018-moreno-beach-perris-ca-usa.html)). All of this makes “Cellophane” the most played song from the sequence.

I’m In Your Mind Fuzz
The final part of the Mind Fuzz suite is a variation of [“I'm In Your Mind”](https://kglw.net/song/im-in-your-mind?artist_id=1) that is shorter and cuts out the verses and solos. It’s the triumphant end to a ten-plus minute stretch that opens one of the band’s most essential albums — yet out of all of the songs included, the title track has gotten the short end of the stick, easily being the least played of the bunch. Not by too much (only thirty or some shows as of writing) but for a while the song essentially vanished off the face of the Earth.

“I’m In Your Mind Fuzz” debuted on [2014-02-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-9-2014-st-kilda-foreshore-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at St Kilda Foreshore in Naarm (Melbourne) alongside other *[Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)* material under the working title “Bit.” The beginning of the suite, “I’m In Your Mind” was labeled as the same, which means that the two songs were originally conceived as the same thing, not as two versions of the same idea. It was recorded by Wayne Gordon at Daptone Records in Brooklyn and mixed by Michael Badger and Stu. The song would be included on *I’m In Your Mind Fuzz*, released on October 31st, 2014. It would also appear in a [promotional video](https://www.instagram.com/p/uy4I8Wovw8/) for the album uploaded on the 31st. The bassline of the suite would later reappear at the end of [“The Lord of Lightning”](https://kglw.net/song/the-lord-of-lightning?artist_id=1) on *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)*.


It was played frequently from 2014 to 2016 as part of the suite and even made some notable appearances such as their *[Live In San Francisco ‘16](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-san-francisco-16)* concert film. The song fell nearly completely off setlists from 2017 to 2018, with only a few occasional performances coming out of [“Cellophane.”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane?artist_id=1) The reason for this was that the suite was put to the side in those years while “Cellophane” became the end of a multi-song medley, heavily reliant on *Murder of the Universe* material. The Mind Fuzz suite would return in 2019, but even then the song was not always played. It was played four times in 2020 and 2021, and has re-taken its place in the suite in the tours ever since.

Empty
“Empty” is a simple and introspective track to clean the slate. Brandishing the album’s lofi production with mechanical clicks throughout, the lyrics describe someone who feels like life has changed for the worse, yet finds happiness when next to their certain someone. Despite appearing on one of the band’s most beloved albums, “Empty” is a very rare tune which has not appeared since 2014. It was recorded by Paul Maubury at A Secret Location in Melbourne, with the mix being done by Stu on tour. It was released on October 31st, 2014.


The earliest known appearance of “Empty” was on [2014-02-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-9-2014-st-kilda-foreshore-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at St Kilda Foreshore in Naarm (Melbourne) alongside most of *[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)*. According to the setlist, its working title was “3/4," in reference to the song’s time signature. The song would be played occasionally throughout 2014 with its last appearance on [2014-12-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-december-20-2014-the-hi-fi-melbourne-australia.html) at The Hi-Fi in Naarm (Melbourne). A performance of “Empty” from [2014-11-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-november-1-2014-state-university-of-new-york-at-binghamton-vestal-ny-usa.html) would later appear in the compilation/documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=458s)*.

Hot Water
On the band’s website, [Stu described](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/im-in-your-mind-fuzz) what the band was listening to when making 2014’s *[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)*: “We were all really getting into classic Kraut Rock at the time and loved those repetitive, motorik beats…” For the uninitiated, Krautrock or kosmische musik, is a genre of rock out of late ‘60s Germany. Known for its very distinct drum patterns, improvisation and experimental production, krautrock would be wildly influential both within rock and outside of it (Kraftwerk were a krautrock band for example). Perhaps no other song on *Mind Fuzz* exemplifies this inspiration more than “Hot Water.” With its [“Hallogallo”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zndpi8tNZyQ)-esque vibe, earworm melody and delicate flutes, the song is a standout piece of psychedelia. Pair that with some of the band’s earliest lyrics about the environment, as well as being the first of the fan favorite “water jams'' (such as [“Muddy Water”](https://kglw.net/song/muddy-water?artist_id=1) and [“Open Water”](https://kglw.net/song/open-water?artist_id=1)), and you have an essential piece of the Gizzverse.

Before performing the song on [2021-12-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-19-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html), Ambrose says the song is an “old one” and that Joey wrote the main riff — with Joey adding on that it was one of his first. In fact it’s the only song from the *Mind Fuzz* record to have the songwriting credit “Walker/Mackenzie.” While many *Mind Fuzz* songs appeared as early as February of 2014, the earliest known performance of “Hot Water” happened on [2014-09-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-18-2014-ding-dong-lounge-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Ding Dong Lounge in Naarm (Melbourne). Early versionsstart with flute flourishes before heading into the base song. While other *Mind Fuzz* songs had different lyrics early in their live histories, “Hot Water” was completely finished. It would be played at least two more times before being released on Halloween day. The studio version was recorded by Wayne Gordon at Daptone Records in Brooklyn, with a mix done by Stu in the band’s tour van. Unlike the live versions, the studio version fades in with no flute until the main melody.

“Hot Water” continued to be played throughout the end of 2014 into 2015 where it would be given a simple drum intro. It had no concrete placement in setlists until around [2015-09-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-september-12-2015-the-pour-house-music-hall-raleigh-nc-usa.html) when [“Robot Stop”](https://kglw.net/song/robot-stop?artist_id=1) began to be introduced to the band’s live sets. At that point “Hot Water” would become a jam within early versions of “Robot Stop.” This continued in 2016, cementing the two as a notable jam during the *[Nonagon](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* era. Footage of the song in this timeframe appears multiple times in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=458s)*. “Robot Stop” was released as the opener of *Nonagon Infinity* on April 26th, 2016. In the finalized version, it would contain the main melody of “Hot Water” towards the end of its break (where the song appeared in live versions), marking one of the first cross album references in the band’s discography, which was then extrapolated into the idea of the “Gizzverse.” The pairing of “Robot Stop” and “Hot Water” began to change in June of 2016 as the band began to play more of *Nonagon Infinity* live. Here, the band would start with the first few songs of the album then play a few other tunes before heading back in. “Hot Water” would appear later in the sets after “Road Train” as the band reprised “Robot Stop.” Based on our data, “Hot Water” would drop off of sets at the beginning of 2017 before coming back in America around [2017-09-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-september-23-2017-district-square-kalamazoo-mi-usa.html), once again being paired with “Robot Stop.” While being in heavy rotation, “Hot Water” vanished in 2018 returning on [2019-07-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-12-2019-thebarton-theatre-adelaide-sa-australia.html) at the Thebarton Theatre in Adelaide. While the song had often been accompanied by “Robot Stop,” it was beginning to drift away, once again becoming a solo song. Compared to older versions, 2019 versions of the song are generally longer and more focused on improvisation. It did appear next to [“Road Train"](https://kglw.net/song/road-train?artist_id=1) on [2019-07-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-13-2019-astor-theatre-perth-wa-australia.html) and with its old pal “Robot Stop” on [2019-10-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-19-2019-razzmatazz-barcelona-spain.html), but was generally split from Nonagon material in this time. In 2021 the song was a reinvention for the band’s acoustic shows. While older versions were wild, the acoustic versions capture the chill attitude of the original. In 2022 as the band began to tour again after the COVID-19 lockdown, “Hot Water” returned, starting with an appearance at the Return of the Curse of Timeland festival on [2022-03-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). The next show it appeared at ([2022-04-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-11-2022-humphreys-concerts-by-the-bay-san-diego-ca-usa.html)) would see a unique [“Mr. Beat”](https://kglw.net/song/mr-beat?artist_id=1) > “Hot Water” > [“Trapdoor,”](https://kglw.net/song/trapdoor?artist_id=1) demonstrating that as the band entered their “jam band” phase, it was no longer tied to any constraints. The song would also be played alongside “Robot Stop” yet again, though not as much as other years (see [2022-06-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-17-2022-great-stage-park-manchester-tn-usa.html)). As of writing, “Hot Water” sits right outside of the top ten most played songs by the band.

Am I In Heaven?
A recurring theme within the band’s discography is climate change. While some albums focus on the warming temperatures and melting ice in a more abstract, disconnected sense, such as *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)*, others such as *[Petrodragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)* and *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)* make blunt, brutal attacks in the form of concept albums. Outside of the music, the band has been dedicated to doing their part with compostable bags for their [Gizzverse webstore](https://gizzverse.com/) and a lack of shrinkwrap on their records. It’s impossible to ignore the band’s focus on our world and the biggest threat to it, but where did it come from? Well, if you trace the band’s history and go album by album, you’d find that it started only a few years after the band began, on the second side of *[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)* with the dynamic psych-rock jam “Am I In Heaven?” Debuting months before the album’s other environmental song “Hot Water,” this is the start of the band’s devotion towards saving the planet. Stu sings of how he has visions of the apocalypse watching humanity tear Mother Nature to shreds for our own needs, putting her “to the test.” It’s a simple song from a songwriting perspective and was reflective of [Stu’s vision of society](https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-enter-your-mind-fuzz). “With the latest record, a lot of the themes are about the modern world. The songs are about climate change and mind control and stuff like that. The modern world is inspiring.” Humanity's selfishness in the face of catastrophe has to make you ask “am I in Heaven or am I in Hell?” The song has cemented itself as a classic over the years, appearing consistently since its debut.

The first reported appearance of “Am I In Heaven?” was on [2014-04-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-6-2014-barwon-club-hotel-geelong-vic-australia.html) at the Barwon Club Hotel in Geelong, and became a  common selection through 2014. While some *Mind Fuzz* tracks featured different lyrics early on, existing recordings of the song pre-studio recording showcase the song’s final lyrics. The song had no real placement in the sets, sometimes (based on our knowledge) appearing near [“Head On/Pill,”](https://kglw.net/song/head-on-pill?artist_id=1) other times being a mid-set jam session. The song was recorded by Wayne Gordon at Daptone Records in Brooklyn and mixed by Micahel Badger and Stu. “Am I In Heaven?” would be released as part of *I’m In Your Mind Fuzz* on Halloween Day, 2014. The song’s motifs reappear throughout the album. The chorus melody is played in both “I’m In Your Mind” and “I’m In Your Mind Fuzz,” while the main riff from the instrumental break can be heard at the end of [“Slow Jam 1.”](https://kglw.net/song/slow-jam-1?artist_id=1) 


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KH_r9SOi_hQ?si=Ki0TfdEcMyX9wLca&amp;start=3165" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


Post-release, “Am I In Heaven?” would become a concert staple. It was played throughout 2015, typically appearing at the end of sets with a transition into “Pill” during the middle of the year. Around this time “Am I In Heaven?” was a jam vehicle, though this would end around September when the song would be placed wherever needed. While it was a staple tune for that time, it seemed to fall off of sets in 2016, sometimes being played as an encore, such as on [2016-02-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-february-18-2016-electric-ballroom-london-england.html). The song would, however, appear multiple times in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=458s)*. The break didn’t last long as 2017 saw the track return, this time as a pretty reliable closer from March to June — though it did appear as an opener on [2017-10-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-october-7-2017-neurolux-boise-id-usa.html). From 2017, versions of the track start to get even longer and based more in improv than before. For example a performance of the song on [2017-06-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-22-2017-cabaret-sauvage-paris-france.html) is sixteen minutes long and features a number of teases. Another break would occur in 2018 with the song only being noted at three shows in August, once again as a closer. However, while appearing less, it only seemed to grow larger: one instance on [2018-08-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-22-2018-manufaktur-schorndorf-germany.html) is a staggering twenty minutes in length with teases and dynamic builds. While “Am I In Heaven?” was always a great tune live, something undoubtedly changed in these years, and 2019 was possibly the song’s best year. While only appearing ten times, these versions were high action jams that often served as closers and ranged from nine to sixteen minutes in length. The song was played once in 2020 as a closer on [2020-02-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-february-8-2020-footscray-park-melbourne-australia.html), with only one appearance the following year on [2021-12-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-20-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html) as part of “Jam Night” at the Princess Theatre in Brisbane. As the band entered their jam era in 2022, “Am I In Heaven?” was a no-brainer. While some were in the nine to thirteen minute range, long jams were not off the table with [2022-05-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-21-2022-kemba-live-columbus-oh-usa.html) having a nearly thirty-minute version blending elements of a number of songs both old and new. The song remains one of the band’s longer jams helped greatly by the improvisational nature of their jam-band era.

Slow Jam 1
As the title suggests, “Slow Jam 1” is the first of the slow jams on *[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)*. A simple track about the need to slow down and breathe, the song’s mellow atmosphere, analog production and callback to [“Am I In Heaven?”](https://kglw.net/song/am-i-in-heaven?artist_id=1) create a relaxing though short break.

The song was recorded by Paul Maybury at A Secret Location in Melbourne and co-mixed by Stu with a final release on October 31st, 2014. [On January 16th, 2015 the song was given a music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb3tBvyXcT4). Shot and edited by Jamie Wdziekonski with effects and post production by Jason Galea, it features black and white stills of the band which are animated and looped. A few months later a [CD single](https://www.discogs.com/release/10716641-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Slow-Jam-1/image/SW1hZ2U6Mjk4OTg0MzM=) would be released.

“Slow Jam 1” was first reported live on [2014-09-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-18-2014-ding-dong-lounge-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Ding Dong Lounge in Naarm (Melbourne) and would be played a handful of times throughout the end of 2014, with the final reported performance from the year being on [2014-12-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-december-20-2014-the-hi-fi-melbourne-australia.html). Based on available recordings, these versions of “Slow Jam 1” didn’t vary much from the original but were longer with a jammed outro. The only notably different version would be [a short acoustic medley of both Slow Jams from 3RRR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VsLNLuqydc).  In the following years the song did not appear on any known setlists, though it did appear in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=458s)*. The song would reappear after an over four hundred show gap on [2021-07-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-25-2021-splendour-xr-online-the-internet.html) as part of the Splendour XR Online ‘Festival’ — which was played in virtual reality. Just like the 2014 versions the song would go on longer with an extended ending. A clip of Stu mixing the audio for this performance of the song can be heard in their behind the scenes video *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=624s)*. Following its initial comeback “Slow Jam 1” would be turned into an acoustic number for the band’s all-acoustic shows on [2021-12-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-13-2021-brunswick-ballroom-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) and [2021-12-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-19-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html). The electric version of the song would see multiple performances throughout 2022, this time often running past the ten-minute mark. This trend of improvisation-led versions would continue in 2023, when the song would make it to the Red Rocks residency [(2023-06-08)](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-8-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa-2.html). In an [interview with Relix](https://relix.com/articles/detail/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-a-beautiful-mind-fuzz/) from 2023, Stu mentioned that the Slow Jams returned to the sets because they were easy to play with little rehearsal needed.

Satan Speeds Up
While not as well known as many songs on *[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)*, “Satan Speeds Up” is one of those oddball tunes that’s as endearing as it is rare. With heavy tape effects, loads of wah wah and some intense tremolo, the song is a great slower tune for the back half of the album, no matter how satanic it may be. The focus is on religion and how humanity’s “silly games” (war, industrialization, etc.) create a world of chaos and instability on God’s creation. At every second we’re being judged for these actions yet we still continue. It’s certainly a cynical look at belief and the song carries an unsettling eeriness to it.


“Satan Speeds Up” was first played on [2014-02-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-9-2014-st-kilda-foreshore-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at St Kilda Foreshore in Naarm (Melbourne) as part of a set containing many *Mind Fuzz* debuts. According to the setlist, the song’s working title was “Hip Hop,” perhaps due to the song’s drum beat. The song would then drop off the setlists immediately afterwards, to a point where very few people even knew it was played at all. This was made worse by the fact that no recordings of its debut exist. The song was recorded by Paul Maybury at A Secret Location in Melbourne with a mix done by Stu on tour. *I’m In Your Mind Fuzz* would be released on October 31st, 2014 with the song being its penultimate track.

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmV7Cmv8QXg) by Jason Galea and Peter Burr was released on November 6th, 2014. Initially teased in a [promotional video](https://www.instagram.com/p/uy4I8Wovw8/) for *Mind Fuzz*, it follows the band wearing different outfits as they do various activities around New York. Eric wears black glasses, jacket and hat while walking around with a cane. His right hand is the hand of a mannequin. Lucas is continuously running in a winter coat and hands Ambrose money during the beginning of the video. Ambrose is a skateboarder wearing a gray beanie. Cook is a dog with face paint and fur blanket. He urinates on a fire hydrant and is led around by Stu, who sings while wearing a devil mask and red dress. Joey wears a pom beanie while smoking and posing throughout the video. Cavs gets his laundry done and dresses up like a pimp with a clear umbrella. The video was shot around October 30th/31st and was lip-synched with a slowed down version of the track which was then sped up during editing. Outtakes from the shoot can be found at 44:14 of the band’s documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=458s)*. In a [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i89q8fk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from May of 2022, Galea would state that it was the video he had the most fun making, with Stu also having it on his list of favorites. Cook’s appearance in the video would later be referenced on the poster for [2019-07-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-5-2019-unsw-roundhouse-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html).

For almost a decade “Satan Speeds Up” went completely missing. When a Twitter user (appropriately named @satanspeedsup) mentioned how much they wished that the song was played on 2015-07-06, [the official account responded](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/618202112363732994?s=46&t=rCZG-larCnBsxWi14aRslg) “that songs way too hard man.” It wasn’t until the early show at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado on [2023-06-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-8-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html) that the song would reappear. Ambrose introduced the song as one that they had never played before, but Stu corrected him and explained what happened on [2014-02-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-9-2014-st-kilda-foreshore-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). “Actually we did play it once... No, we played it once. We played it once in 2014 at St. Kilda fest, I remember, and it went really badly so we never played it again.” Ambrose then responded “that’s probably why I deleted it from my memory.” It was played two more times in 2023, one time at The Salt Shed in Chicago ([2023-06-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-11-2023-the-salt-shed-chicago-il-usa.html)) and another time at Parco Della Musica in Padua ([2023-08-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-22-2023-parco-della-musica-padua-italy.html)). Live versions of the song are close to the album and feature no jamming.

Her and I (Slow Jam 2)
Opening to the sound of The Rolling Stone’s 1968 song [“Country Honk,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fx_VjKjJ3I) the final song of *[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)* is the album’s sweetest. “Her and I (Slow Jam 2),” much like the [first Slow Jam](https://kglw.net/song/slow-jam-1?artist_id=1), is lyrically simple with heartfelt declarations about marriage and love. Unlike “Slow Jam 1,” however, this song expands into a longer track with multiple progressing sections and unique production, becoming the longest track on *Mind Fuzz*. Stu said it was one of his favorites during the band’s [2022 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i89pxij/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). While one dormant in the band’s catalog, the song has  grown longer and more intense, becoming a massive jam and the highlight of several shows.

The setlist for this show as well as a performance from [2014-05-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-7-2014-happy-dog-cleveland-oh-usa.html) indicates that the working title for the song was “Angel,” a word taken directly from the lyrics. To our knowledge the song was only played a handful of times in 2014, with one being a part of [a short acoustic medley of both Slow Jams from 3RRR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VsLNLuqydc). For *I’m In Your Mind Fuzz*, the song was recorded by Paul Maybury at A Secret Location in Melbourne, with its mix being done by both him and Stu. It was released on October 31st, 2014.

[In an interview with Relix from 2023, Stu mentioned that the Slow Jams returned to the sets because they were easy to play with little rehearsal needed.](https://relix.com/articles/detail/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-a-beautiful-mind-fuzz/).

Cellophane (Single)
The Wholly Ghost (Speeds Up)
King Gizzard has released hundreds of songs since their debut single in 2010. In their discography there are tons of songs that fans have argued are “underrated.” One may argue a track like [“30 Past 7”](https://kglw.net/song/30-past-7) is overlooked by the weirdo swarm, while another might say [“Superposition”](https://kglw.net/song/superposition) hasn’t gotten its due, the next may say it’s time for [“Nein”](https://kglw.net/song/nein) to get some love. Yet there’s one thing that these songs have in common — they appeared on an album. Whether it’s an official studio release or a bootleg demo compilation, the material is part of some collection of material that we can hold in high regard. Even vinyl exclusive tracks like [“Dawn of Eternal Night”(https://kglw.net/song/dawn-of-eternal-night) made it to a record. It’s a genuinely rare thing for an original song by this band to not be widely accessible, yet there is one. A track that is out there and sometimes makes its presence known but lingers in the background. A specter of a song, always floating around but never fully noticed or recognized. Fittingly, the song is titled “The Wholly Ghost” — a short, quirky song that stands as their only non-album B-side.


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qep3Z3aRFNs?si=SemdpqTD-VfwysfM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


The song’s earliest sighting was on [2014-02-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-9-2014-st-kilda-foreshore-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the St. Kilda Festival in Naarm (Melbourne). After a long set of soon to be *[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)* debuts (based on our knowledge), “The Wholly Ghost” made its way in. Over the next few months the song would appear on the band’s setlists though its unclear how common it was. The song made it to America for King Gizzard’s first U.S. show at the Austin Psych Fest on [2014-05-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-2-2014-carson-creek-ranch-austin-tx-usa.html), which would end up being an important date for the song though we’ll get back to that in a later section. On [2014-06-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-12-2014-babys-all-right-brooklyn-ny-usa.html) a performance of the song at Baby’s All Right in Brooklyn, New York was recorded and would be incorporated into Jason Galea’s documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w)*. The song was performed a few more times but disappeared after [2014-07-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-july-12-2014-babys-all-right-brooklyn-ny-usa.html) never to be heard on stage again. “The Wholly Ghost” may have been played a few other times throughout the year but no evidence exists as of writing. While mentioned by the band that the song might be played again during the *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnqcmbg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), the song has yet to reappear.

On September 16th the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qwdxKkmhoc) for the song [“Cellophane”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane) was released. Around the same time a [folder](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/w3iy7m2mpo9bp/CELLOPHANE) on the file hosting service Mediafire received some files and was linked under the video. One of these files contained both “Cellophane” and a studio version of “The Wholly Ghost,” now stylized as “The Wholly Ghost (Speeds Up).” The song fits right in with the *Mind Fuzz* material and features the band with heavy tape effects. The effects shift the pitch up from the key of F to G, and sped up tape towards the end of the track brings the song to the key of G# before ending at C. The song’s lyrics (written by Stu) are straightforward—it’s about wanting to meet a ghost. A [7” single](https://www.discogs.com/release/6317602-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Cellophane) of “Cellophane/The Wholly Ghost” was released on November 17th, after which“The Wholly Ghost” fell into obscurity. The song would be released on streaming services as part of the [“Cellophane” single](https://kglw.net/discography/cellophane-the-wholly-ghost) but is region locked so that fans in the United States cannot access it. When [asked about the region lock](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/14xhsy0/rip_wholly_ghost/), Lucas jokingly said “it doesn’t exist.” It wasn’t until the release of the official bootleg *Live at Levitation ‘14* on December 11th, 2021 that the band would show the song off again. 


There has been some speculation around the song in the years since its disappearance mainly centering around why the song never made it to an album. While the band has not stated anything concrete, Reddit user PLASTOSPLEEN [investigated](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/jyq53e/evidence_for_an_alternate_tracklist_for_mind_fuzz/) the waveforms of *I’m In Your Mind Fuzz* and found that the song was most likely intended to be on the album between [“Satan Speeds Up”](https://kglw.net/song/satan-speeds-up) and [“Her and I (Slow Jam 2).”](https://kglw.net/song/her-and-i-slow-jam-2-2) And if you wonder if Stu sings “wholly” or “slowly,” [Stu clarified it himself](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1548762315604086785?s=20) on Twitter.


Getting your hands on the studio version of “The Wholly Ghost” isn’t necessarily hard but it can trickier than most. While it does appear on streaming services, it is region locked and may not appear for you depending on location. YouTube uploads exist but are in lower quality than the actual song file. The [Mediafire folder](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/w3iy7m2mpo9bp/CELLOPHANE) still exists but it’s unclear how long the link will stay up. The song was uploaded to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/the-wholly-ghost-speeds-up) and will last there until the page is deleted or the site goes down. As for obtaining a vinyl copy, be prepared to spend a chunk of money. According to the music database and marketplace [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/release/6317602-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Cellophane) the median price for the 7” is $225 USD/$353 AUD/€213 EUR. A [test pressing](https://www.discogs.com/release/10200379-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Cellophane) of the single also exists but it has never been sold and is probably worth much more. While [CD singles](https://www.discogs.com/release/10985432-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Cellophane) exist for “Cellophane,” they do not contain “The Wholly Ghost.” 
Quarters!
The River
Perhaps no other song in the King Gizzard discography holds as much importance as “The River” — a ten-minute-and-ten-second-long jazz jam released as the opener of *[Quarters!](https://kglw.net/discography/quarters)*. [Described as a turning point by Lucas](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/quarters), the song sets up much of what King Gizzard is known for. Mind melting jams that will slay audiences for years to come? Check. Iconic imagery that helped define the aesthetic of the band? Check. Ideas that the band will later reference to create an interconnected musical web? Check. A unique four part structure concept that defines the music itself? Check. Use of a non-standard time signature? Check. The song has also been a prominent part of the band’s repertoire with [radio perfromances](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-september-2-2015-kexp-studios-seattle-wa-usa.html) and inclusions in films *([Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*, *[Live in San Francisco ‘16](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-san-francisco-16)*).

“The River” goes back to 2014 when the band were living in a cabin in Upstate New York, traveling into New York City for gigs and recording dates. Stu said in an [interview with Guitar World](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/the-10-best-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-songs-so-far): “That song was written in the middle of summer, when we were renting a ski lodge in Hunter Mountain in upstate New York, where we recorded most of *[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)*, but we wrote a handful of other songs there that ended up on different records, and this was one of them.”
The song is a significant compositional leap for the band, and a full dive into the use of non-standard time signatures that they had begun experimenting with on the previous album. As well as the jazzy, jammy style, “The River” uses the shuffling 5/4 beat of Dave Brubeck/Paul Desmond’s jazz standard [“Take Five”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Five), and heavily interpolates several other aspects of the song including its rhythm (‘da nana da na-na’) and uses a very similar melodic shape. While the album was very loose, Quarters! works around the concept of having four songs with a runtime of exactly ten minutes and ten seconds; a limitation that Stu said in a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmcmz6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) gave the track its second and fourth sections.“The River” was recorded primarily at Daptone Records in Brooklyn on November 3rd, 2014. Some of this session was filmed and put into the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w)*. Here we get to see them not only jam the song’s second section with a different rhythm, but also put down the first nearly-final version. Other parts of the song were recorded while the band was touring Europe. At 59:51 of *BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL* we see Stu prepping to record a harmonica part in a car. According to Ambrose, this was to record “The River.” In an [episode of The Vinyl Guide podcast](https://www.thevinylguide.com/episodes/ep325-ambrose-kenny-smith-the-murlocs-king-gizzard?fbclid=IwAR2vEkH2yv3AIrmqoar-5PSidoLG56D7FV7p0mpndDtufBQpz2xGmrxjzzw), he said “some of the harp is recorded like, in the van when we’re like, touring in Europe. We just like, put a mic through the headrest, through the back of the headrest, and I’d be sitting behind just like playing the harmonica when we’d go through the Eurotunnel to France…” He also mentions that his vocals were done in a rented room in London. [Stu said of the overdub process](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/quarters) “we booked a rehearsal room in London and Ambrose and I went in for a day and recorded overdubs. It was a sad, lonely room with black carpet on the walls. But we needed to finish the record. We did more overdubs in green rooms and in the van too. I remember recording harmonica in in the channel tunnel.” The London session was on December 2nd, 2014.

After a [behind the scenes photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/0hQLArIv5l/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) was uploaded to Flightless’ Instagram in March, the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUZn1I6llJs) for “The River,” created by Jason Galea, was uploaded to the band’s YouTube channel. Featuring a blend of 2D and 3D animation, live footage and sculptures, the video is a journey through the *Quarters!* album cover.
Starting in the top left corner ([“Infinite Rise”](https://kglw.net/song/infinite-rise?artist_id=1)) we see a long sequence of 2D animation with a green, red and black color scheme. The next section is introduced through a transparent nonagon which brings us to a representation of the bottom left corner (“The River”) and features a number of gators running across a [frozen river made of cardboard, plaster and paint](https://nofilmschool.com/2016/auteurs-music-video-jason-galea) before going underwater into an icy cavern. After footage of the band recording at Daptone we’re led to another 2D animation segment representing the top right corner ([“God Is In The Rhythm”](https://kglw.net/song/god-is-in-the-rhythm?artist_id=1)) seemingly taken from the Zonkvision film *[Pocket Holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu87_SXjMMk)* before more live action footage from Kaaterskill Falls (Green County, New York) that leads to the final computer animated segment for [“Lonely Steel Sheet Flyer.”](https://kglw.net/song/lonely-steel-sheet-flyer?artist_id=1) Galea said of the project to [No Film School](https://nofilmschool.com/2016/auteurs-music-video-jason-galea), “‘The River’ track has four sections to it and the album was also split into four songs with the four panels on the cover linked up to the four tracks. For me, 10 minutes is a long time to sit on the same sort of visual animation style, and it would have driven me crazy to do it all the same, so I tried to emulate the four different cover sections throughout the one track. We had some tour footage that helped fill it out and connect the worlds… I guess it kind of rolls and flows like a dream sequence, which everyone can relate to in some way. I don’t think I really planned it to be much of a story, but more of a visual ride.” During the *Chunky Shrapnel* [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnquj6k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Galea said that he thought the 2D animation was done frame by frame in Photoshop. The video for “The River” became one of the most iconic for the band, while also setting up a number of important, recurring images in the Gizzverse. The video features nonagons throughout the second section with the gators, predating *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* by a full year. The biggest development of the video was the introduction of the gators. Since their introduction, the gators have become the band’s de facto mascot and would be put on countless shirts, posters and music videos (such as [“Invisible Face,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekXb74bUbRM) [“Fishing For Fishies”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beIDKFwXam0) and [“Ya Love”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbUvwyokv_E)). The video itself would be referenced on posters for [2019-09-03](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-3-2019-joy-theater-new-orleans-la-usa.html) and [2019-10-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-14-2019-lolympia-bruno-coquatrix-paris-france.html). The song received a single edit on a [promotional CD](https://www.discogs.com/release/8649310-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-The-River) released by Heavenly. Clocking in at three minutes and thirty-one seconds, the edit cuts off before the second section with the refrain heard before the closing instrumental of the song. “The River” was released as part of *Quarters!* on May 1st, 2015.

Since its release, the song has been a standard in the band’s live sets. The first known performance of “The River” was on [2015-05-30](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-may-30-2015-the-factory-theatre-sydney-australia.html) at The Factory Theatre in Sydney and would become a commonly played song throughout the year. These versions of the song stuck close to the album structurally, though often featured improvisation throughout — notably during the second and fourth sections. The song was also faster than its studio counterpart, reaching breakneck pace during the previously mentioned improv sequences. Some of these performances would be included in *BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL*. The song remained on setlists in this state throughout the beginning of 2016 but changed in the summer of that year as the band began to play festivals. A shortened version of the song began to come out of [“Evil Death Roll”](https://kglw.net/song/evil-death-roll?artist_id=1) > [“Invisible Face”](https://kglw.net/song/invisible-face?artist_id=1) before sending concertgoers back into *Nonagon Infinity* material with [“Wah Wah.”](https://kglw.net/song/wah-wah?artist_id=1) These versions range from three to eight minutes in length, either cutting off before the second or fourth section. In 2017 the full song returned to sets with jams becoming even faster at times, serving as a closer after [2017-06-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-9-2017-parque-da-cidade-do-porto-porto-portugal.html). In 2018 two variations of the song were in rotation. At the beginning of the year the full track was played often as a closer, much like 2017. Starting in late May however, the song was once again used to go into “Wah Wah” before hitting the second section. In 2019 “The River” appeared in a few forms. Some shows such as [2019-08-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-27-2019-college-street-music-hall-new-haven-ct-usa.html) would see the song played on its own, while, more commonly, the song was put into a massive jam of “The River” (shortened before second or fourth section) > “Wah Wah” > [“Road Train.”](https://kglw.net/song/road-train?artist_id=1) This would later be put into the tour film *Chunky Shrapnel*. The first section would also be teased at the beginning of performances of “Wah Wah” throughout the year. The song was played once before the COVID-19 pandemic on [2020-02-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-february-1-2020-brisbane-showgrounds-brisbane-australia.html) and would reemerge as an acoustic version for the band’s all-acoustic sets starting on [2021-12-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-13-2021-brunswick-ballroom-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Brunswick Ballroom in Naarm (Melbourne). These versions were noticeably longer than previous performances, hitting upwards of sixteen minutes in length. As the band began to tour again and lean more and more into their “jam band” tendencies in 2022, “The River” returned as a complete song but often went on longer with some performances crossing the twenty minute barrier, some becoming [“type II”](https://phish.net/faq/jamming-types) jams. Fans have given nicknames to a few of these renditions for their unique attributes. For example, a performance of the song on [2022-10-10](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-10-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html) (released on *[Live at Red Rocks ‘22](https://kglw.net/discography/live-at-red-rocks-22)*) was given the nickname of “The Evil River” for its sinister and heavy second section, while another from [2023-06-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-11-2023-the-salt-shed-chicago-il-usa.html) (released on *[Live in Chicago ‘23](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-chicago-23)*) was crowned “The Dead River” for its sparse improvisation reminiscent of the Grateful Dead’s [“Dark Star”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Xic-CHInek&t=197s)/[“Space”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRdgJUWF8Hk) jams as well as its [“Fire on the Mountain”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGPeO9jZYvM)-like chord changes. In these years fans [began to row on the ground](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/14dbgjv/remlinger_row_river_pit_was_epic_it_just_kept/) during the song as a tradition of sorts. Outside of the band, Cavs played the song during his [drum seminar at Drumtek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9O9b-U0nl4&t=2822s) in Northcote.

Infinite Rise
“Infinite Rise” is an upbeat ten-minute-and ten-second long track featuring a long string of rhyming but disconnected lyrics and a ton of sound effects. The song utilizes a [Shepard tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6roCzKZ2ls) throughout, an auditory illusion created by playing a number of ascending or descending tones with volume cut offs the higher/lower in pitch they get. In effect the tone seems like it is constantly ascending or descending in an “infinite rise.” It also features a rising bassline during the refrains. It’s the only song from *[Quarters!](https://kglw.net/discography/quarters)* to be entirely recorded by Stu and the only one done entirely at the band’s cabin in Hunter Mountain, New York. Recorded on May 29th, 2014, it was released a year later on May 1st, 2015 as the second track on Quarters! and is represented on the cover with a star rising into the dark, referenced in the [music video for “The River.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUZn1I6llJs)   


Based on available data, “Infinite Rise” has never been played live.
God Is In The Rhythm
A simple but beautiful ten-minute jam, “God Is In The Rhythm” speaks of the cycles of life on Earth, the changing of seasons and our place in the universe at large. Rarely played but a fan favorite, “God Is In The Rhythm” demonstrates the band’s affinity for the natural.


The song was recorded at Daptone Studios in Brooklyn on November 3rd, 2014. In the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w)* the band is seen playing the song in studio and listening to the tape afterwards, with Stu telling engineer Wayne Gordon to crinkle the tape to make it more distinct. “If it sounds really crazy then it sort of, like, makes it more important.” The result is audio cutting out and shifts in tempo, which the band likes. Interestingly, Stu mentions that “it might be like the last track on the album where it all falls apart.” This implies that “God Is In The Rhythm” was a contender for the closer. *[Quarters!](https://kglw.net/discography/quarters)* was largely improvised on the spot, even down to its track listing as seen here. The song was released as part of *Quarters!* on May 1st, 2015 and is depicted on its album cover with red and yellow vibrations and a dragon hiding between them. This would be referenced in the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUZn1I6llJs) for [“The River.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-river?artist_id=1)

The earliest footage of the band playing the song comes from *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w)*  where we see the band rehearsing it at The Knitting Factory on an unknown date (potentially [2014-10-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-22-2014-the-knitting-factory-brooklyn-ny-usa-2.html). The earliest known performance of “God Is In The Rhythm” happened on [2015-06-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-24-2015-babys-all-right-brooklyn-ny-usa.html) at Baby’s All Right in Brooklyn. Stu played the song by himself with a looper pedal, footage of which was also put in *BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL*. No other performances of the song from this era have been documented. In the following years it's unclear if “God Is In The Rhythm” was ever played by the band, though it reappeared for a short run in 2018. Starting on [2018-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2018-olympia-theatre-dublin-ireland.html) at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin and ending on [2018-03-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-16-2018-fuzz-club-athens-greece.html) at the Fuzz Club in Athens, “God Is In The Rhythm” was shortened, slowed down and played as a show closer. These versions, rather than having any lyrics, featured a monologue from the confused cyborg Han-Tyumi who thanked the concertgoers for showing up while sharing a poignant message about unity. Transcribed from [a performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsK6b3TIUfs) on [2018-03-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-1-2018-le-bataclan-paris-france.html): “Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It is a true pleasure to be here. I am humbled and honored to be in your country playing to your beautiful faces. True happiness is found when we, as human beings, are brought together. Together we send vibrations out into the cosmos. Together we sing into the vacuum. Together we smile wide within our faces. [inaudible] I wish you safe travels home. Be careful as you exit, the air is cold. Remember to tell the people that you love how you adore them. Humanity is fragile as is Mother Nature. Be safe and once again, thank you. Thank you. Thank you…” The “thank yous” at the end of the song continued after the band had finished playing. Since March of 2018, the song has disappeared from setlists entirely.

Lonely Steel Sheet Flyer
A calm closer for *[Quarters!](https://kglw.net/discography/quarters)*, “Lonely Steel Sheet Flyer” is a melancholic, psychedelic track centered around a simple chord progression with multiple instrumental flourishes. The lyrics are about a pilot and their lover being separated by distance. The pilot flies in their airplane but deeply misses their loved one, feeling “dead and awake” without them near.


The song was recorded at Daptone Studios in Brooklyn on November 3rd, 2014. Stu, Joey, Cook, Lucas and Cavs played on the track as seen in *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w)*, with Cavs also overdubbing percussion.

It made its live debut two years after release on [2017-09-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-23-2017-district-square-kalamazoo-mi-usa.html) at the Audiotree Music Festival at the District Square in Kalamazoo. It would be played throughout the year afterwards. These versions of the song appear close to the album but are usually shorter than the studio version with cut sections and flute additions. First appearing in the middle of the set, the song became a reliable closer starting on [2017-09-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-september-28-2017-one-eyed-jacks-new-orleans-la-usa.html). Following a performance on [2017-12-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-december-11-2017-san-fran-wellington-aotearoa-new-zealand.html) the song would take a five year break, reappearing on [2022-05-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-may-8-2022-casa-musa-zihuatanejo-mexico.html) at Casa MUSA in Zihuatanejo as a show opener. This would be the song’s only performance that year. In 2023 the song appeared twice, one time in its studio form on [2023-08-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-14-2023-palp-festival-verbier-switzerland.html) seguing into [“The River”](https://kglw.net/song/the-river?artist_id=1), the second time as an acoustic rendition for The Cavern residency on [2023-06-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-4-2023-the-caverns-above-ground-amphitheater-pelham-tn-usa.html).

Paper Mâché Dream Balloon
Sense
“Sense” opens up *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)* on an environmentally conscious note with Stu singing about the hypocrisy of modern society in the face of climate change. He notes how many will say that the threat is on their mind but refuse to take action; opting to buy cars and arguing about their tax money in the face of an existential threat. As the opening line says “it’s in vogue to be feckless when it comes to the mother taking care of us.” Society has deemed its apathy and dishonesty fashionable, and this terrifies Stu, who states that these conflicting ideals make “no sense at all.” The song itself is a jazzy acoustic number with a lead clarinet part. It’s a fan favorite from the album and an essential environmental song from the band, even getting a reference on the *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)* track [“The Hungry Wolf of Fate.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-hungry-wolf-of-fate?artist_id=1) “Sense” was released on November 13th, 2015, with an instrumental being released as part of the deluxe version of *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon* on October 29th, 2021.

The earliest known performance of “Sense” was on [2019-08-31](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-31-2019-930-club-washington-dc-usa.html) at the 9:30 Club in Washington DC. The song was played six times throughout the year on electric guitars and keyboards, as opposed to the acoustic instruments and clarinet found on the original. These versions are also longer than the original and feature a jammed outro. A performance of the song from [2019-10-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-11-2019-carlswerk-victoria-cologne-germany.html) was shown briefly in the film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. “Sense” was then played twice in 2020 before the COVID-19 lockdowns. It returned for the band’s acoustic shows starting on [2021-12-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-13-2021-brunswick-ballroom-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), while this version gets back to its roots, it's in a different key than both the studio version and the 2019/2020 performances. It made a one off appearance on [2022-05-31](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-31-2022-gagarin-205-athens-greece.html) as a show opener, once again returning to electric guitars but with the changed chords of the 2021 acoustic versions. This version was also longer than any previously heard renditions, at over ten minutes in length. The song was played four times in 2023 with performances being heavier than before, while keeping lengths close to the [2022-05-31](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-31-2022-gagarin-205-athens-greece.html) rendition in Greece.

Bone
“Bone” is a short and simple acoustic track with an instantly recognizable main riff and lyrics that discuss what will be left when we all die: a pile of bones. The entire song describes the decay of the physical body and how it’ll end up digested by animals and insects, but also reflects on how we may leave that physicality behind for the afterlife, although this only prompts more questions. The song was released as the second track of *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)* on November 13th, 2015 and featured in a [promotional video](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/videos/1128962820449953/) for the “bootleg” styled pressings of the album on the 20th. It was later put out as a [single](https://www.discogs.com/release/8871691-King-Gizzard-The-Lizard-Wizard-Bone) on February 12th, 2016. An instrumental version with a longer outro was released as part of the deluxe edition of *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon* on October 29th, 2021.


“Bone” has not been played live.
Dirt
Focusing on the subject of arguments and their effects on people, “Dirt” is a poetic, peaceful acoustic number written and led by Joey. It was released on November 13th, 2015 with an instrumental version with a longer outro releasing as part of the deluxe edition of *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)* on October 29th, 2021.

A demo for “Dirt” can be found on [Demos Vol. 1: Music To Kill Bad People To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-1). This version is slower and much more psychedelic, with sparse but heavily modulated instrumentation. The only difference to the lyrics is that the second chorus isn’t shortened like on the studio version.

“Dirt” made its live debut on [2019-10-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-11-2019-carlswerk-victoria-cologne-germany.html) at Carlswerk Victoria in Cologne, and was played once more that year at La Riviera in Madrid on [2019-10-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-18-2019-la-riviera-madrid-spain.html). These versions were fully electric and stayed close to the original. While the song was not played in 2020, it returned during the band’s acoustic show at the Brunswick Ballroom in Naarm (Melbourne) on [2021-12-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-13-2021-brunswick-ballroom-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). It would then be played on [2021-12-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-19-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html) and a year later on [2022-04-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-13-2022-arlington-theatre-santa-barbara-ca-usa.html). These acoustic versions are even closer to the studio version than the already faithful 2019 performances.
Paper Mâché Dream Balloon
The title track for *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)* is a breezy acoustic song with tempo changes, eerie fiddle and prominent flute that, [according to Stu](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmawzv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), is about “taking troubles and turning them into something else.” In the lyrics Stu sings about daydreaming to escape his troubles, though he learns that he can deal with his issues by sticking them to a “chimera balloon” and abandoning those thoughts. By creating this multifaceted balloon, he is able to free himself from worrying by letting it float away. It was released on November 13th, 2015 alongside a [two song flexi-disc sampler](https://www.discogs.com/master/1646720-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Paper-M%C3%A2ch%C3%A9-Dream-Balloon-Sampler) which also featured the song. An instrumental version with a unique outro was released as part of the deluxe edition of *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon* on October 29th, 2021.

A visualizer-like [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lci8-n8K394) for the track by Jason Galea was published on August 17th, 2015. It shows the album cover in front of moving clouds with a simple yellow border. The speed of the clouds moves faster during the choruses. 


The only reported live performance of “Paper Mâché Dream Balloon” was on [2016-02-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-february-27-2016-bi-nuu-berlin-germany.html) at Bi Nuu in Berlin. No recording of this performance exists, though a claim was made on setlist.fm that it was played by Stu solo as an encore.
Trapdoor
The most bizarre and spooky song on *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)* is “Trapdoor” — a fast-paced, Krautrock inspired piece with repetitive lyrics. The lyrics describe a trapdoor, but keep what’s behind itr vague by saying that everyone already knows what’s there, and that we all collectively hide it. Perhaps the band is commenting on our desire to hide our darkest secrets and fears behind our own trapdoors, or more literally that there is some mythical beast being locked away — expanded upon with its tease in [“The Balrog”](https://kglw.net/song/the-balrog?artist_id=1) a few years later. “Trapdoor” is the most famous and most played song from the album, with its mysterious lyrics and unique instrumentation making it a fan favorite from their 2015 output and beyond. It was released as a [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AiUhifux2g) on September 22nd, 2015, and then as part of *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon* on November 13th, 2015. It also appeared on a [two song flexi-disc sampler](https://www.discogs.com/master/1646720-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Paper-M%C3%A2ch%C3%A9-Dream-Balloon-Sampler) released at record stores alongside the album proper. An instrumental version featuring an outro with double bass noodling was released as part of the deluxe edition of *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon* on October 29th, 2021.

Jason Galea’s [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN3kH4hchrA) for “Trapdoor” was released on November 10th, 2015. Starting with a quick shot of the band’s miniatures from the album’s cover in front of a miniature castle, we then see various clips of the band before cutting to Eric wearing a knight's outfit walking to an actual castle. Inside Cavs, Cook and Eric are wearing robes while Joey acts as the dining table with his head surrounded by fruits and vegetables. We see Stu playing flute and singing by candlelight while wearing a ghostly white cloth. Later on, Ambrose is seen wearing a black robe and singing with Stu. The video is chaotic, with fast cuts, flashing lights, shots of various props and filtered footage of the band walking up stairs and singing.  
In an [interview](http://nofilmschool.com/2016/auteurs-music-video-jason-galea) for NoFilmSchool, the video was compared to the works of Monty Python and Alejandro Jodorowsky. When asked what inspired the video, Galea said “We made this video on tour in Europe. We were waiting to find the right idea or place to make a goofy music video, and one night we played at this massive concrete venue in Hamburg which was a Nazi bunker in World War II. There were some really cool props and bits laying about that were perfect for a ‘Trapdoor’ clip and it all just happened pretty easily over a couple of hours. A few days later we shot the outside scenes at the Nottingham Castle using props from the gift shop. I haven’t watched much Monty Python at all, but in Australia, there were a lot of British programs on television when I was growing up, so from time to time I’ll go into this weird '80s BBC mindset when making videos.” The Hamburg venue he refers to is Uebel & Gefährlich, where the band played on [2015-06-29](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-29-2015-uebel-gefahrlich-hamburg-germany.html). The band played Rescue Rooms in Nottingham a week later on [2015-07-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-july-6-2015-rescue-rooms-nottingham-england.html). Footage of the band recording the video was featured in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=4502s)*. Eric and Joey’s costumes from the video were later referenced on the poster for the band’s gig at the UNSW Roundhouse on [2019-07-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-5-2019-unsw-roundhouse-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html).

The earliest known performance of “Trapdoor” was on [2015-08-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-23-2015-la-sports-arena-exposition-park-los-angeles-ca-usa.html) at the LA Sports Arena & Exposition Park for California FYF Fest, months before the release of *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon*. No recordings of the song from 2015 exist, though during their [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb062/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu said that “Trapdoor” was his favorite song from *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon* to play live. In 2016 the song was in heavy rotation. These versions are close to the studio version but are much heavier, with growling vocals from Stu, falsetto vocals from Ambrose, light synthesizer work and wah wah guitars. The final performance from that year (that we know of) was on [2016-09-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-9-2016-o2-ritz-manchester-england.html), after which it would take a long break, although there had been some thought as to bringing it back. In the band’s [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6qjwb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Stu mentioned that he wanted to revive the song after hearing the version from [2016-05-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-25-2016-the-independent-san-francisco-ca-usa.html) (released ten days before the AMA, on *[Live In San Francisco ‘16](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-san-francisco-16)*). Two years later on [2022-03-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) during The Return of the Curse of Timeland festival, the song was brought back — this time coming out of [“Sea of Trees.”](https://kglw.net/song/sea-of-trees?artist_id=1) It would then be played six other times that year. These versions either came out of other songs like [“Hot Water”](https://kglw.net/song/hot-water?artist_id=1) ([2022-04-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-11-2022-humphreys-concerts-by-the-bay-san-diego-ca-usa.html)) or “The Balrog” ([2022-10-10](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-10-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html)), although other times it was played on its own. These versions often ran longer than the studio version and featured a longer intro, a longer outro, or both. This was brought back for 2023, although the song saw a reinvention with the introduction of an acoustic rendition on [2023-06-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-4-2023-the-caverns-above-ground-amphitheater-pelham-tn-usa.html) at The Caverns in Pelham. At the beginning of the year, Stu also joined the band Los Bitchos to perform [their version of the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpsAtDUCR_I) during their opening set.

Cold Cadaver
In “Cold Cadaver,” Stu sings of an odd situation regarding a relationship. One day the narrator’s (former?) girlfriend panics and knocks on his front door. When asked why she’s so distraught, she responds that the issue is a dead body which is bloating and rotting away. While the meaning of the story is left ambiguous, it could be commenting on the relationship by comparing their love to a corpse. The song’s origins were explained by Stu in an [interview](https://lagroupie.ch/post/141779699305/interview-stu-mackenzie-from-king-gizzard-the) with La Groupie. “I was messing around with this simple melody. It didn’t have any words or anything, I was at the farm and I was kind of stuck with it. I was reading *[The Day of the Triffids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Triffids)*. It’s just a line in the book that got into my head, and then all of a sudden I was improvising on some weird concept that didn’t really mean anything to do with the book. It was just some little ideas. I think I just sang into the microphone that minute and that was the song, that was done.” The song is gleeful with an energetic pace, a bright instrumental and some sitar thrown in. It was released on November 13th, 2015 with an instrumental version releasing as part of the deluxe edition of *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)* on October 29th, 2021.


“Cold Cadaver” has not been played live.
The Bitter Boogie
One of the band’s most famous boogies is “The Bitter Boogie,” a four-minute bluesy jam written by Ambrose and Stu. The verses, sung by Stu, describe a short temper that its narrator says “comes without warning.” They try to control it and hope that, despite their bitter nature, it's not reflective of who they truly are. Ambrose’s verses follow a different rhythm, but expand on this person’s personality as well as their ways of coping with stress. “The Bitter Boogie” features piano, acoustic guitar, bass, harmonica and clarinet, as well as some unique sections with a guitar string getting tuned down in real time. It remains a beloved track within the weirdo swarm, a reputation helped by its live versions that serve up explosive and expansive takes on the boogie. It was released as part of *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)* on November 13th, 2015. An instrumental version was released as part of the deluxe edition of *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon* on October 29th, 2021. Interestingly, the “instrumental” version of the song keeps Ambrose’s vocals and has a unique intro with studio noise.

The earliest known performance of “The Bitter Boogie” was on [2018-11-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-november-23-2018-enmore-theatre-sydney-australia.html) at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney. It was then played at the following two shows. These versions were electric and ran longer than the studio version with more jamming. The song returned in 2019 as a prominent closer throughout much of the year, although by [2019-10-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-11-2019-carlswerk-victoria-cologne-germany.html) it began to be placed elsewhere. These versions could reach upwards of thirteen minutes in length and allowed Ambrose to work the audience. A performance of the song from [2019-10-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-15-2019-alcatraz-milan-italy.html) can be briefly heard in the film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. The song was not played in 2020 but returned on [2021-10-30](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-30-2021-sidney-myer-music-bowl-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) for Play On Victoria at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. The next two performances of the song were the first acoustic renditions on stage, starting with [2021-12-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-13-2021-brunswick-ballroom-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Brunswick Ballroom in Naarm (Melbourne). Going forward, both the electric and acoustic version remained in the band's lineup. For 2022 the electric version had returned to being a closer, although this changed yet again in 2023.

N.G.R.I. (Bloodstain)
N.G.R.I. is a [legal anagram](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0202607310) for “not guilty by reason of insanity.” Say that someone is accused of murder, a lawyer could theoretically argue that their defendant is not guilty because they truly believed that their actions weren't wrong due to their mental illness. While the plea is not a guaranteed solution, if it is ruled by the judge that the defendant was in that unwell state, the defendant is acquitted on charges but often required to go through some sort of therapy or to a mental institution. Despite this dark subject matter, “N.G.R.I. (Bloodstain)” is one of the most upbeat songs on *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)*, with fast piano, groovy bass and hints of sitar. The song follows a quiet person who believes that they can summon demons in their room, although it's revealed that, outside of their daydreams, their room is covered in their own blood. Their only defense for such a scene is that they’re N.G.R.I., although they feel as if it's all normal, even calling it “mundane.” The song was released on *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon* on November 13th, 2015 and used in a [promotional video](https://twitter.com/ATORecords/status/665205659550490624?s=20) for the ATO vinyl pressing. An instrumental version was later released as part of the deluxe edition of Paper Mâché Dream Balloon on October 29th, 2021.


“N.G.R.I. (Bloodstain)” has never been played live. In the band’s [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6qjwb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu mentioned that they may have rehearsed it at one point.
Time = Fate
“Time = Fate” is the only Cook-led song on *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)* and focuses on how our memories fade with time, as well as how nostalgia can keep us from growing. Cook’s emotional lyrics serve as the first of two examinations of time on the album are soundtracked by acoustic guitar, double bass, piano, flute and drums. Stu revealed a bit of info about the song in a [Guitar World Magazine article](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/the-10-best-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-songs-so-far) which named it one of the band’s ten best songs. “This song is a Cookie Craig-penned song. We recorded it out in the country in rural Victoria, where we converted a shipping container into a studio. I’m not sure if other people can hear it as a shipping container, but when I listen to that record, I just [hear] the specific reverberation in the room.” The song was released on November 13th, 2015 with an instrumental version released as part of the deluxe edition of *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon* on October 29th, 2021.


“Time = Fate” has not been played live, but Stu said in the band’s [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6qjwb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that they may have rehearsed the song at one point.
Time = $$$
The shortest song on *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)* is “Time = $$$” (pronounced in the song as “time is money”). With an upbeat rhythm and bright guitars, the song follows someone with little money who notices their gums bleeding and their eyes itching. They question the phrase “time is money” by turning it on its head, changing it from a quote about laziness to one about the passage of time becoming a form of payment. It was released on November 15th, 2015 with an instrumental version being included as part of the deluxe edition of *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon* on October 29th, 2021.


“Time = $$$” has not been played live.
Most Of What I Like
The second Joey-penned song on *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)* is “Most Of What I Like,” a reflective look at a fraught relationship. Its narrator recognizes that the things they like in life exist because of their lover but, despite knowing that their inability to confront their partner’s interests and desires is causing the rift in the relationship, they refuse to change to make it better. The relationship is compared to a corpse that “should never be displayed.” “Most Of What I Like” is a mid-tempo song with simple instrumentation and layered background vocals. While the track is mostly calm, the outro injects life into the track with the introduction of clarinet and the piano taking a prominent role. It was released on November 13th, 2015. An instrumental version was released as part of the deluxe edition of *Paper Mâché Dream Balloon* on October 29th, 2021.

A demo for “Most Of What I Like” appeared on *[Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2)*. This version is a slow, psychedelic pop track with drum machine, brittle synthesizer parts and wobbly guitars. The lyrics are the same as they appear on the final version.

“Most Of What I Like” made its live debut on [2021-12-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-13-2021-brunswick-ballroom-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Brunswick Ballroom in Naarm (Melbourne) and reappeared on [2021-12-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-19-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html). These performances were for the band’s acoustic shows and featured an extended outro with lots of harmonica from Ambrose. The performance from [2021-12-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-19-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html) was released as part of *[Live In Brisbane ‘21](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-brisbane-21)* and was featured in a [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3biltlyRjM) for the release. The song would be played twice in 2022: at an acoustic show in Santa Barbara on [2022-04-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-13-2022-arlington-theatre-santa-barbara-ca-usa.html) and on [2022-06-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-1-2022-gagarin-205-athens-greece.html) for a unique electric version without Cavs in Athens. It was then played twice in 2023 with a similar split. The band performed another acoustic version at The Caverns in Pelham on [2023-06-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-4-2023-the-caverns-above-ground-amphitheater-pelham-tn-usa.html), but did a fully electric performance during their early show on [2023-06-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-8-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html) at Red Rocks Ampitheathre.

Paper Mâché
Closing out *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)* is a short instrumental titled “Paper Mâché.” It's an acoustic medley of every song on the album, with Stu playing the melodies on flute. The ending of the song is a chaotic, incomprehensible string of sounds that ends with a loud bang similar to the drums heard at the beginning of [“Vegemite.”](https://kglw.net/song/vegemite?artist_id=1) When [slowed down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPorw9GguDo), the sounds are revealed to be “Paper Mâché” played back at varying speeds. The song was recorded entirely at The End in Brooklyn, New York in June of 2015 by Jacob Portrait (of Unknown Mortal Orchestra fame). Footage of the sessions can be found in *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=1487s)*. Interestingly, the footage reveals that the song was recorded at a lower pitch than the final version, meaning they had pitch-corrected the track afterwards. The song was released on November 13th, 2015.

“Paper Mâché” has never been played live.
Nonagon Infinity
Robot Stop
From the first seconds of this song it’s clear that *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* is going to send you on a trip. A mythical proclamation is our greeting: “Nonagon Infinity opens the door, wait for the answer to open the door…” You are then plummeted into a brash jam, both heavy and mind-bending, before meeting a strange depiction of a touring band. They loosen up to fuck shit up on stage. It’s energetic and exciting but also incredibly tiring. The lyrics explain that exasperation through images of overworked bodies that might as well be put into robot ones unable to feel pain or drowsiness. The band does it all for the “weirdo swarm,” and their music serves as a way to escape. It’s a recognition of their success as well as their lifestyle. [Stu described](https://atorecords.com/featured/pre-order-new-king-gizzard-album-nonagon-infinity-listen-to-gamma-knife-on-beats1/) the song to ATO Records in March of 2016. “That song’s about feeling overworked, like a bit of a robot that’s just going to crash and die or something but you get yourself up and do it again and you robot on and you’re alright. It was one of the early ones we wrote for the record, and I think when that song came together, everybody started to feel like we’re going to actually be able to pull off this never-ending album idea.” It features a few firsts for the band. As the opener of Nonagon Infinity, it’s the first song to mention the iconic title. It's also the first King Gizzard songs to feature a microtonal guitar — an element that would be a defining trait for the band going forward and a central feature of their next album *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)*. Joey has [also mentioned](https://uproxx.com/indie/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-review-discography/) that it was one of the first times the band built a song around an odd time signature in a way that became a core feature to the album, something which defines releases like *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)* and *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)*. Like the songs that follow it on *Nonagon Infinity*, “Robot Stop” is self-referential. At the 3:29 mark Stu plays the riff of [“Big Fig Wasp”](https://kglw.net/song/big-fig-wasp?artist_id=1) which is followed by the main motif of [“Hot Water”](https://kglw.net/song/hot-water) from *[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)* at 3:59. Motifs from “Robot Stop” also reappear in “Big Fig Wasp” and [“Evil Death Roll”](https://kglw.net/song/evil-death-roll). To fit in with the album’s looping context, the album’s closer [“Road Train”](https://kglw.net/song/road-train) wraps around into “Robot Stop” during its final moments. In five minutes “Robot Stop” sets up a world of chaos that the album will explore and just might “open the door” to the band behind the music. When fans talk about classic, if not definitive, King Gizzard songs, it’s impossible not to mention “Robot Stop.”

The earliest performance of “Robot Stop” was on [2015-6-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-12-2015-great-stage-park-manchester-tn-usa.html) at the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. In the early days “Robot Stop” featured different lyrics which were relatively hard to make out and seemingly improvised on the spot. This is most noticeable during their shows at the Happy Dog in Cleveland on [2015-6-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-14-2015-happy-dog-cleveland-oh-usa.html) and [2015-6-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-15-2015-happy-dog-euclid-tavern-cleveland-oh-usa.html) where you can hear Stu change the phrases in the verses (note the addition of “fuck shit up” on the 15th). Interestingly the phrase “Nonagon Infinity” was not around at the time, in its place a phrase that seems to be “heavenly scene.” Even the song’s tempo changed throughout the months with versions of the song from June being noticeably slower than their September counterparts. The title was up in the air early on as on [2015-6-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-15-2015-happy-dog-cleveland-oh-usa.html) Stu says that the song has a working title of “New New Song.” “Robot Stop”’s connection to “Hot Water was also forming at this time as various performances saw the songs combine together into one cohesive piece. 2015 renditions of “Robot Stop” can be heard multiple times in Jason Galea’s documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=4484s)*. By [2016-02-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-15-2016-gorilla-manchester-england.html) the song had been formed into what is known today, and recorded at Daptone Records in Brooklyn by Wayne Gordon with vocals recorded by Michael Badger in his bungalow. In an [interview with Audio Technology](https://www.audiotechnology.com/features/king-gizzards-lo-fi-gut-feeling), Stu reveals that his vocals were run through the Little Alterboy plugin. The song would be [teased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZyr128ww4U) as part of their upcoming looping album *Nonagon Infinity*, which was released on April 29th, 2016. On vinyl copies, the song is given its own unique mix with the end of “Road Train” at the beginning of the track. The song would later be used to [promote the band’s festival Gizzfest](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/videos/the-return-of-gizzfest/1356515037694729) with [Jason Galea filming a performance](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/videos/only-two-gizzfests-leftsat-03-dec-thebarton-theatre-adelaide-httpbitlygizzfestad/1405654386114127/) of the song.

On August 8th, 2016, a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p_Si21ig7c) for the song was released on YouTube. Created by Jason Galea, the video was [made in Cinema 4D with effects added in After Effects](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/jason-galea-animation-170816). It utilizes a limited color scheme of red, yellow, black and white and shows a wide array of mechanical devices, gears, displays, and robots while occasionally showing the face of Stu singing the song. Towards the end of the video, a swarm of mechanical wasps are shown awakening a giant wasp who is grabbed by another robot (later identified as Han-Tyumi) and decapitated. To take an eye for an eye however, the robotic wasp shoots saw blades out of its eyes which cut its attacker’s arms and head off. Galea cited [H.R. Giger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._R._Giger), [Heavy Metal magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Metal_(magazine)), *[Transformers: The Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transformers:_The_Movie)* and more as influences on the video. “Robot Stop” features two firsts for the band as it marks the debuts of the cyborg Han-Tyumi who would be properly introduced two albums later on *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* as well as Stu’s Flying Microtonal Banana (here depicted as a mechanical bug). Like all music videos from *Nonagon Infinity*, “Robot Stop” was meant to be a part of a [Nonagon Infinity film](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/763153703071166465?lang=en) that would have been made up of videos for each song. This idea was never realized, making “Robot Stop” one of the four completed segments. In the years following the music video’s release its imagery has reappeared at different times. Of course Han-Tyumi would become iconic for the band, but the video has also seen some other references since then, for example on the posters for [2019-08-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-13-2019-greek-theatre-los-angeles-ca-usa.html) and [2019-10-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-13-2019-rockhal-club-esch-sur-alzette-luxembourg.html).

In a live setting the song has seen some changes over the years. In 2016 the song was played relatively straight with no major changes outside of missing the microtonal guitar. The song would often serve as the set opener and would transition into “Big Fig Wasp.” Other times the song would veer into “Hot Water” before going back into “Robot Stop” proper. In the summer of 2016 some shows revolved around the looping concept of *Nonagon Infinity* and featured a reprise of “Robot Stop” at the end of the show. In 2017 the song began to take a back seat, appearing towards the middle and end of sets and setting up tracks like [“Gamma Knife”](https://kglw.net/song/gamma-knife?artist_id=1) and “Hot Water.” Around this time the band would begin to incorporate teases of Hawkwind’s [“Master of the Universe”](https://kglw.net/song/master-of-the-universe) into the track (see [2017-9-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-september-27-2017-variety-playhouse-atlanta-ga-usa.html) before “Hot Water”) which would continue into 2018 where the song would become the start of *Nonagon* medleys that would close the shows. The version of the song from [2018-08-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-19-2018-walibi-holland-biddinghuizen-netherlands.html) would appear in *[THE NONAGON MOVIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV8knE56GE4)*. Setlists became more unpredictable by 2019, meaning that “Robot Stop” could appear anywhere (including the documentary *[RATTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AzPaId5Qc&t=132s)*) but the song was still played close to the album. After the COVID-19 pandemic, the band would enter their jammy phase and “Robot Stop” was not immune. The song was given a longer intro and outro which pushed it over the seven-minute mark (such as on [2022-06-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-17-2022-great-stage-park-manchester-tn-usa.html)) and it has gotten longer since, with some reaching a little over fifteen minutes in length ([2023-06-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-7-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html)). “Robot Stop” stands as one of the band’s most played songs, taking the second place under “Gamma Knife.”

Big Fig Wasp
Blastophaga psenes (or fig wasps) live pretty interesting, though admittedly a bit disgusting, lives. These wasps are really small and only live a few days, but what makes them unique is that their lives are dependent on figs, hence the name. They lay eggs within the flower of the fig, and when the male larvae hatch, they fertilize the females while they are still growing, dig a hole for them to escape through, and die. After scavenging for pollen, the female finds another fig and the cycle continues. To make it clear, [you’re not eating dead fig wasps when you eat a fig](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/figs-and-wasps), but I don’t blame you if you are a bit weirded out after that. Gizzard makes it more disgusting by asking this question: what if you bit into a fig and there was a *big* fig wasp? “Big Fig Wasp” is the second track on 2016’s infinitely looping album *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* and keeps the high energy going through the first side. The song centers on these insects and portrays them as godless creatures that the song’s protagonist accidentally eats, adding to the distorted soundscape and world of the album.

A demo for the song (released on *[Demos Vol 4. Music to Die To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-4)*) outlines the song in its early form. The song is completely instrumental with its main riffs intact, albeit picked differently. The rest of the song however isn’t there. An unused section first appears at 0:52 where the band accents two different chords. Another new section (potentially the original verse) first appears at 1:17. Past that point the various breakdowns and [“Robot Stop”](https://kglw.net/song/robot-stop?artist_id=1) reprise/outro are completely missing. While most of *Nonagon Infinity* was recorded at Daptone Records in Brooklyn, New York, “Big Fig Wasp” was mainly recorded at A Secret Location in Melbourne by Paul Maybury, with vocals recorded by Michael Badger. [Badger stated](https://www.audiotechnology.com/features/king-gizzards-lo-fi-gut-feeling) that the material recorded at A Secret Location was notably higher quality from a recording standpoint compared to Daptone with “a lot more top end.” This may have been due to the fact that the band redid “Big Fig Wasp.” According to an [interview for goetiamedia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcSCJgkAg3o&t=9s), the band recorded the track twice because it “needed a bit more love.” The first time the song was heard was on Nonagon Infinity itself, released on April 29th, 2016. It borrows tonally from “Robot Stop” before it, and brings back the song for a reprise at the end before transitioning into [“Gamma Knife.”](https://kglw.net/song/gamma-knife?artist_id=1) Like the rest of the songs on the album it was intended to have its own music video, though details on the plans for “Big Fig Wasp” have not been released. Wasps are prominent in the video for “Robot Stop” and a Wasp Man would appear in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f78_Tf4Tdk&pp=ygUPcGVvcGxlIHZ1bHR1cmVz)  for [“People-Vultures”](https://kglw.net/song/people-vultures?artist_id=1) as well as *[ПАДАЮЩИЙ СНЕГ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4Nqfbuqke8)*, giving hints to the potential content of the unmade video.

The first known live performance of the song was on [2016-05-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-may-4-2016-mercy-lounge-nashville-tn-usa.html) at the Mercy Lounge in Nashville, Tennessee where it appeared after “Robot Stop” > [“Hot Water”](https://kglw.net/song/hot-water?artist_id=1) at the beginning of the set. This would be one of the song’s most common placements moving forward, same with “Robot Stop” > “Big Fig Wasp.” No matter what, the song was used when playing the first section of *Nonagon Infinity* and hasn’t been used outside of that purpose. It didn’t matter if it was a festival or a radio show, “Big Fig Wasp” was a part of the *Nonagon* suites that opened the shows. In 2017 however, the song would be removed from the line up with the suite typically “Robot Stop” > “Gamma Knife.” On [2018-02-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-18-2018-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) the song would come back after a ninety-nine show gap (based on current setlist knowledge) to be played throughout the year. Before the year was done, a slowed down version of the song would appear in *ПАДАЮЩИЙ СНЕГ* where a Wasp Man also appears. As setlists became more varied in 2019, the song would again fall out of favor and became an occasional thing rather than an essential track. It was played once in 2021 during the Princess Theatre residency for “Garage Rock Night” ([2021-12-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-22-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html)) and brought out a handful of times since.

Gamma Knife
Back in the late 1940s and early 1950s, a Swedish neurosurgeon named Lars Leksell faced a problem which he was dedicated to finding an answer to. Sometimes patients had tumors and lesions that were small enough that conventional surgery couldn’t really help. Leksell’s idea to solve this issue was a bit wild. Instead of opening up the head, they could use radiation. If one were to concentrate the protons into beams and then aim them at a specific small target, you could create a level of radiation large enough to kill the tumor/lesion without harming what’s around it. The idea sounds crazy but this is the driving idea behind modern radiosurgery. Leksell, alongside Ladislau Steiner and Börje Larsson, would invent the [Gamma Knife](https://med.virginia.edu/neurosurgery/services/gamma-knife/for-physicians/history-and-technical-overview/) in 1967. The machine has been adopted across the world to fight brain tumors and has no doubt saved many lives. Forty-nine years later the band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard would name a song after Leksell’s innovations, a song that in fact has nothing to do with radiosurgery. “Gamma Knife” focuses on a quest for physical and spiritual youth and a narrator willing to cut through skin for the purpose. With its high energy, references to other points within the Gizzverse and a unique drum solo, it’s one of the band’s most popular tracks, to the point of it making [appearances in TV shows](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/114r71k/was_watching_the_new_show_my_dad_the_bounty/). As of writing, “Gamma Knife” is the most played song in their live career. It has one of the band’s most popular music videos as well. There aren’t many King Gizzard songs that have the same staying power as this one.

Joey noted in an [Uproxx interview](https://uproxx.com/indie/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-review-discography/) that “Gamma Knife” was one of the the first times they had experimented with time signatures that would go on to define a whole album, as opposed to standing out different from the the rest of the tracklist. It’s also a first for Cavs, as it features a drum solo during its instrumental break, though he wasn’t initially convinced to do it. As Stu said to [Flavorwire](https://www.flavorwire.com/573813/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-so-post-music-not-even-the-lead-singer-can-describe-it#:~:text=Cavs%20%5BMichael%20Cavanagh,his%20low%20ego.) “Cavs is a brilliant drummer, but he’s very modest. He’s not an ego drummer who wants to do a big solo… He was like ‘No, no, I don’t want to do a drum solo.’ And then I think when this song came around, it’s got that kind of like — maybe 11/8 or a bar of six and a bar of five in a row? — so, I think he had this thing where this guitar thing was happening where he could do, like, a drum solo or drum break that wasn’t really self-indulgent. It took a bit of convincing, which I guess is a testament to his low ego.” The first known appearance of the song was on February 23rd, 2015 when Joey [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/zcd03usfPL/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) of Ambrose recording a harmonica part for an early version of the song to his Instagram page. Unlike the final version, this was recorded at A Secret Location Sound Recorders with Paul Maybury. The band [were recording the album at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnqxnog/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) but ended up taking a break to work on *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)*. It (to our knowledge) debuted at the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee on  [2015-6-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-12-2015-great-stage-park-manchester-tn-usa.html). There’s a trend with *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* material to start with unused lyrics and even some different instrumentals and “Gamma Knife” is no different. Looking at [2015-6-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-19-2015-bowery-ballroom-new-york-ny-usa.html) for example, we hear some radically different lyrics, get a different section before the drum break after the first chorus, and totally miss the “gamma” yells by the band. The song lacked its complete identity even by early 2016 ([2016-2-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-february-15-2016-gorilla-manchester-england.html)) and it wasn’t until [2016-2-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-february-28-2016-z-bau-nuremberg-germany.html) that the lyrics we know had finally been set. In a live setting at this point, it wasn’t always given the [“People-Vultures”](https://kglw.net/song/people-vultures?artist_id=1) outro. Going back to 2016-2-28 we can hear that the song abruptly ends without moving into the next track. An early version of the song, as well as rehearsal footage, can be found in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=458s)*. “Gamma Knife” would be recorded at Daptone Records in Brooklyn, New York by Wayne Gordon with vocals recorded at the bungalow of Michael Badger.

The song was teased in a [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZyr128ww4U) for *Nonagon Infinity* on February 25th and debuted on [Apple Music’s Beats 1 radio show](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/posts/1188767614469473). A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC7ii3Ir-no) and [single](https://www.discogs.com/release/8871682-King-Gizzard-The-Lizard-Wizard-Gamma-Knife) were released that same day. Directed by Jason Galea and Danny Cohen, it features the band playing in robes at Emerald Lake Park in Victoria. Each member’s face is painted a different color and as the video progresses, various monks ([referred to as wizards by Galea](https://www.instagram.com/p/BIUSXCmDlX9/)) in cloaks of each color make their way to the band before plunging their daggers into the ground, creating the shape of the nonagon. At the end of the video the band and the old men are scattered across the ground with a massive egg in the middle, setting up the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f78_Tf4Tdk) for “People-Vultures.” Originally [Cohen and Galea envisioned](https://nofilmschool.com/2016/auteurs-music-video-jason-galea) the video close to [early Black Sabbath television footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti36edmfaZk) with the band playing the song on stage but went in a more psychedelic direction. [Cohen stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIncwa_9RsM&t=1s) that the concepts for “Gamma Knife” and its sister video (spinning camera and giant creature with the band) were originally one but split to make a story, leading to the concept of the unfinished *Nonagon Infinity* movie. Going into the project Cohen felt that the videos shouldnt’ stray far from what Galea had set up previously and that “Gamma Knife” was [inspired](https://directorsnotes.com/2016/06/09/danny-cohen-people-vultures/) by the Alejandro Jodorowsky’s films *[El Topo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Topo)* and *[The Holy Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holy_Mountain_(1973_film))*. The video’s spinning camera was achieved by cameraman Joel Betts who ran around the tripod with everyone else in the crew running behind so they wouldn’t be in the shot. As for the color of the monks/wizards, this was a reference to an old version of the *Nonagon Infinity* cover which featured nine distinct illustrations representing the nine songs on the album, each with a differently colored background . The cloaked monks/wizards would later reappear in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekXb74bUbRM) for [“Invisible Face”](https://kglw.net/song/invisible-face?artist_id=1) and the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd3vwwXArMQ) for [“The Lord of Lightning vs Balrog”](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe) with the blue monk/wizard making an appearance in the [“Black Hot Soup"](https://kglw.net/song/black-hot-soup) [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daz_doXNAB4). He would later be called the “Soup Wizard” on the poster for [2022-04-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-19-2022-marquee-theatre-tempe-az-usa.html). The yellow wizard (referred to as simply “wizard”) would appear on the poster for [2019-07-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-5-2019-unsw-roundhouse-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html). Jodorowsky’s influence on the video was direct, so much so that [he would contact Cohen](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/707771744518443009?s=20) on March 8th, 2016. The contents of the email are unknown, but he would [later state](https://x.com/alejodorowsky/status/730751950908719104?s=20) his appreciation for the video on Twitter. The videos for “Gamma Knife” and “People-Vultures” were [combined and released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oNVggJylqQ) on June 5th, 2016. *Nonagon Infinity* was released on April 28th, 2016 with “Gamma Knife” as its third song, sitting between [“Big Fig Wasp”](https://kglw.net/song/big-fig-wasp) and “People-Vultures.” The song would end up hitting number sixty-one on [Triple J’s Hottest 100](https://x.com/triplej/status/824469224714153984?s=20) of 2016, and was nominated for the [APRA’s Song Of The Year](https://themusic.com.au/news/apra-drops-top-20-contenders-for-song-of-the-year-and-theyre-big/tcGmqairqq0/19-01-17#:~:text=Gamma%20Knife%20%E2%80%94%C2%A0King%20Gizzard%20%26%20The%20Lizard%20Wizard%C2%A0) category. In 2017 the band used a live version of the song in  a [promotional video for Gizzfest III](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1741795815833314).

Following its release, the song was heavily played on tour. Despite its consistent rotation, the song has not evolved much since *Nonagon*’s release, only being moved in the setlist over time. In early 2016 the song was typically played at the beginning of the show as a standalone song before being played as it appeared on *Nonagon Infinity* in May. Going into 2017, as the band was introducing new material (such as their microtonal output), “Gamma Knife” was getting pushed towards the middle of shows before ending up at the back by the end of the year. This year also saw the disappearance of “Big Fig Wasp”, leading to combinations like “Robot Stop” > “Gamma Knife.” In 2018, the recently removed song would return, but the set placement for *Nonagon* would stay the same. 2019 setlists were loosely structured which meant that the ”Gamma Knife” could be placed anywhere, a trend which has continued to this day. The only noticeable change came in 2023 as the band introduced a loose middle section before Cavs’ drum solo. Outside of the band, Cavs played the drum break during his [first drum seminar at Drumtek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9O9b-U0nl4&t=2822s) on September 21st, 2022.

People-Vultures
Few songs in the King Gizzard discography start as ominously as “People-Vultures.” Stu’s slow twelve-string ascending riff leads to an evil sounding jam before sending the listener straight into a heavy, hellish track where the titular “people-vultures” wait to tear their prey apart. While on its own the lyrics are violent, the song actually serves as a metaphor inspired by the band’s heavy touring schedule. In an [interview with the Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/in-the-court-of-the-gizzard-king-20160628-gptx3u.html), Stu said "I guess I was at a show and it was full of people-vultures. It's not supposed to be negative. We love those weirdo kids, obviously." The people-vultures aren’t merely these fantasy creatures but a representation of the audience ready to take the band in. The song remains a big part of the band’s legacy as the energetic link between [“Gamma Knife”](https://kglw.net/song/gamma-knife?artist_id=1) and [“Mr. Beat”](https://kglw.net/song/mr-beat?artist_id=1), or it could be a dark standalone song to reckon with. It was the focus of an iconic but dangerous music video. It was even in [commercials for the AFL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZUqPEKqg_E). One of the band’s most well-known and frequently played tracks, it remains a vital part of the Gizzverse.

The earliest version of the song we know of happened on [2015-8-29](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-29-2015-rickshaw-stop-san-francisco-ca-usa.html) at the Rickshaw Stop in San Francisco, California. Like other early versions of *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* songs, its lyrics were hard to make out. These versions of the song contain obscure, if not nonsensical “stream of consciousness” lines such as “noble, faded, that’s just grating, final, useless, what else have we got left to spew down?” Some lines from the final version, such as “God approaches, final hearing,” can be made out in these renditions, but the song is largely different from what ended up on the album. The song’s apparent debut, as well as versions from band rehearsals, would eventually be incorporated into the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=458s)*. “People-Vultures” was one of two tracks from the album to be recorded at multiple locations: Daptone Records in New York (recorded by Wayne Gordon) and A Secret Place in Melbourne (recorded by Paul Maybury) with vocals recorded by Michael Badger in his bungalow. In an [article for Audio Technology](https://www.audiotechnology.com/features/king-gizzards-lo-fi-gut-feeling) it was revealed that the intro and outro specifically were recorded at A Secret Place with everything else presumably being recorded at Daptone. The song was [teased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZyr128ww4U) as part of their album Nonagon Infinity in February, given a [single](https://open.spotify.com/album/4XTJH1K1fEUXe9a26slqwu on April 5th and released on *Nonagon Infinity* on April 28th. On vinyl versions of the album it’s the final song on side one and is given its own unique outro that connects to “Mr. Beat.” “People-Vultures”, like many songs on *Nonagon Infinity*, deals with being on the road in some form. The main riff of “People-Vultures” would reappear on 2017’s *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* as the intro of its second story, “The Lord of Lightning vs Balrog” titled [“Some Context.”](https://kglw.net/song/some-context) It would also be heard in the unlisted YouTube video *[amb sax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20jxMPd9FdM)*.

The story of “People-Vultures” in video form starts on March 8th, 2016 with the release of the [“Gamma Knife” music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC7ii3Ir-no). At the end of the video, seven cloaked men stab the earth with knives only to reappear surrounding a mysterious egg in the next scene as the intro of “People-Vultures” plays. A month later on April 4th the band released the [“official audio” video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZQP4xG6Txc) for the song, which features 3D text and flashing VHS effects which ends with no transition into “Mr. Beat.” When [posted on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1212531012093133), the band included a written passage about it. “Our blue planet is parched and cracks are forming underfoot and the sweat drips from our collective temple onto the citrine sand and a feathered doom encircles us from above and there's a pulsing in our breast telling us there ain't nothing any mere mortal can do when the sun retreats and blackness sets in. Call upon God to deliver us from our peril.” On May 6th, 2016, the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f78_Tf4Tdk) for “People-Vultures” dropped. Directed by Danny Cohen and Jason Galea and put together by one of the largest crews for any Gizzard video, it featured the band playing their instruments as part of a giant cardboard vulture which attacks a number of enemies. These opponents (Robot Man, Wasp Man and Invisible Face Man) reference three songs from the album. The prize for beating all three men is Stu’s Hagstrom F-12 which floats to him during the final section of the song. The video was [inspired](https://directorsnotes.com/2016/06/09/danny-cohen-people-vultures/) by tokusatsu shows like *[Ultraman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraman)* and *[Kamen Rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider)*, as well as Alejandro Jodorowsky films such as *[The Holy Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holy_Mountain_(1973_film))* and [El Topo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Topo)*. In an [interview with Cohen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIncwa_9RsM&t=1s) he stated his idea going into the project. “I guess with King Gizzard they already had such a, like, strong visual side to them which had been created by Jason Galea who co-directed ‘Gamma Knife’ and ‘People-Vultures’ and so I didn’t want to take it too far away from that world.” Originally the concept for the “People-Vultures” video was meant to fit in with “Gamma Knife”’s spinning camera but the two ideas were split, leading to the idea of the never finished *Nonagon Infinity* movie. [While Galea came up with the ideas in the video](https://nofilmschool.com/2016/auteurs-music-video-jason-galea), the vulture’s wooden frame and cardboard body were made by Box Wars with another team for the exterior. The costumes seen throughout were created by Phoebe Taylor and Ash Pierce. It was a gargantuan effort by the crew that ended up being dangerous. According to Cohen the vulture was six meters tall and weighed a tonne with all of the necessary people inside of it. The filming was rough due to the hard to navigate landscape and large scale cardboard figure, which was made all the more nail-biting as the band had their 2016 US tour a week later. [Stu remarked](https://web.archive.org/web/20160719094118/https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-radar/how-king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-created-2016-s-craziest-video) half jokingly, “What a crazy day. 18 hours in a mammoth 20 foot avian Frankenstein monster made of cardboard, pine and latex. 13 people inside the beast at any one time — seven Gizzards, one stabilising my head, two puppeteering the wings and three to push our friend along the rocky terrain. I think I permanently injured my spine wearing that awkward, bulky burdensome head on a backpack and every night since, I've had nightmares about that claustrophobic cavity. Everyone is severely traumatised by the ordeal — Joe has been left mentally scarred and Ambrose sadly passed away. We buried him at the You Yangs. RIP my friend :(” The entire creative process behind the video took three weeks in total. The video was also the first to be labeled as part of the *[Nonagon Infinity film](https://dangerousminds.net/comments/watch_the_righteously_insane_new_video_from_king_gizzard_the_lizard_wizard)* which would have been composed of music videos for each of the songs. While it never materialized, it’s one of the few remnants of the project. Only a few days after it was released, [Alejandro Jodorowsky tweeted](https://x.com/alejodorowsky/status/730751950908719104?s=20) about the video saying “¡Qué divertido!” (“what fun!”). The videos for “Gamma Knife” and “People-Vultures” would be [combined into one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oNVggJylqQ) and released on June 5th, 2016. “People-Vultures” was later [named](https://www.instagram.com/p/BM8SumgDn9e/) Triple J’s “Music Video of the Year”. The video’s iconography has appeared in a few places since its release. In 2017 [unused footage](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPmSyiYA7Dr/) from the video was played behind the band with a live version of the song being used in a [promotional video for Gizzfest III](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1741795815833314). That Gizzfest also had a [cutout of the vulture which you could take photos with as part of the festivities](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/photos/pb.100044289166773.-2207520000/1785867398092822/?type=3). The Wasp Man and Invisible Face Man appear in the video *[ПАДАЮЩИЙ СНЕГ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4Nqfbuqke8)*. The poster for [2019-08-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-16-2019-roseland-theater-portland-or-usa.html) depicts the music video’s vulture with other vultures replacing the band and [2021-12-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-22-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html) depicts the People-Vulture (sans band) as a kaiju. Even the fighters have gotten some love, being depicted on posters for [2019-07-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-5-2019-unsw-roundhouse-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html), [2019-08-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-28-2019-central-park-summerstage-new-york-ny-usa.html) and [2023-06-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-7-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html)). As for the fate of the actual People-Vulture, it made a few appearances after the music video was published. Eric said during King Gizzard’s KEXP interview on [2019-08-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-18-2019-kexp-studios-seattle-wa-usa.html) “we first took it on a boat to Tasmania and we set it up at a show at a festival there; it’s kind of like an arts festival and they asked if we can bring it, so we worked out— cause it’s massive, it’s really hard to carry — worked out, put it on a van and then traveled in on a boat over to Tazzy and got it back.” This would have been for the Dark Mofo Festival on [2016-06-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-18-2016-odeon-theatre-hobart-tas-australia.html). It made a final appearance on [2016-11-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-26-2016-coburg-velodrome-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at Gizzfest 2016. Eric said “...we took it to Gizzfest and I think we just put it in the crowd and, like, all the fans, like, grabbed it and used it and then apparently it’s in a fan’s, like, basement or something. Or it’s in their garage, that’s what we heard, but we haven’t seen it since, it just got taken after…” Photos from the day [posted to the band’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/photos/crushed-vulture/1416074405072125/) show that the head, feet, wings and feathers were there. A [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/10jbk52/framed_the_people_vulture_feathers/) indicates that at least one of the people who worked on the video kept some remnants of the vulture as well.

In early 2016 the song appeared near the end of the sets before moving to the front in its album placement in May. At this point “People-Vultures” was usually connected to “Gamma Knife” but would sometimes be cut off and teased. These moments were labeled as performances of “Some Context” by fans. In 2018 the song stuck with its fellow Nonagon songs and usually served as the closer for festival gigs. As sets became more unpredictable in 2019, the song began to move around and detach from “Gamma Knife” and “Mr. Beat” although it would sometimes reappear in that form. While “People-Vultures” was now free to be played wherever the song was played close to the album. This wouldn’t change until 2023 when the band would begin to extend the song with a quieter section early on, leading versions of the song like from [2023-08-29](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-29-2023-le-bikini-toulouse-france.html) to reach over ten minutes in length.

Mr. Beat
*[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* is known for its lo-fi heavy garage rock sound, its infinitely looping concept and its imagery of hungry vultures, devils and robots. Yet there’s one song that sits as an enigma on the album. It’s not heavy, it debatably doesn’t fit the concept with an actual ending rather than a transition, and its lyrics aren’t necessarily happy but certainly more cheeky. “Mr. Beat” sits at the middle of the album yet it feels the most unusual. In a live setting it’s anything but as it fulfills a very specific function. For whatever reason, the song has been in an unusual spot throughout its lifetime but it’s far from skippable. It’s a clever “pick me up” song created to lift spirits after the ominous “People-Vultures.” It’s the light at the end of the tunnel. Potentially the most distinct thing about “Mr. Beat” is that it plays around with its time signature thematically. To understand this, let’s quickly learn how to count time signatures. The average Western song is in 4/4 (counted “one, two, three, four”) and is the backbone of most popular music from rock to hip hop. For example, put on a Gizzard tune like [“Good to Me”](https://kglw.net/song/good-to-me) and count to four on beat with the guitars. The four beats you’re counting are the first 4 in 4/4, telling you what you’re counting. The bottom four indicates what type of notes we’re counting, in this case quarter notes. Let’s look at “Mr. Beat” with the same counting in mind. You’ll notice that you’ll “miss a beat” as the song puts it. That’s the concept. “Mr. Beat” is not in 4/4 but  instead in 7/8 time (counted “one and two and three and four and five and six and seven and…). Where we should hit our eighth note we wrap back around to the start, thereby missing a beat. This is the backbone of the song’s lyrics and the band plays around with the idea of missing something that is there. The bridge specifically plays on musical terminology with lines about “missing a bar” and ringing ears. The rest of the song deals with a world gone wrong and plays around with homophones (“Mr. Beat, only missed a beat”).


The song was recorded by Wayne Gordon at Daptone Records in Brooklyn and first dropped as the third and final [single](https://www.discogs.com/release/9767231-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Mr-Beat) for *Nonagon Infinity*, released April 28th, 2016. During the album’s development it was thought that “Mr. Beat” might come too late in the tracklist as the first four songs might come off as too chaotic, though the album’s various recording intricacies [seemed to keep this worry at bay](https://www.audiotechnology.com/features/king-gizzards-lo-fi-gut-feeling). “A few of the songs were done at Secret Location, so the interlude bits had a slightly different sound, which I liked, because it gives your ears a break. The first mellow song on the record is ‘Mr. Beat,’ and that’s track five. I was worried with the first four tracks being so chaotic that track five would be a bit late for an ear break. But the slightly different sounding interludes and changes in sonics from song to song felt like a little break for your ears.” The song references [“Evil Death Roll”](https://kglw.net/song/evil-death-roll?artist_id=1) during its outro to set up the track. Unlike the other songs on *Nonagon Infinity* “Mr. Beat” has a definitive end that doesn’t transition into the next track. Outside of the composition, “Mr. Beat” is the first track on the second side of the vinyl release with a unique fade in that is not on the digital version. 


A music video for “Mr. Beat” was planned as part of their *Nonagon Infinity* film. In a [write up about the “People-Vultures” video](https://directorsnotes.com/2016/06/09/danny-cohen-people-vultures/), director Danny Cohen said “the next video in the series is an animation by Jase which I hear should be out pretty soon.” Despite it apparently being nearly ready, the “Mr. Beat” video failed to materialize.

The earliest known performance of “Mr. Beat” was on [2016-06-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-25-2016-the-triffid-brisbane-australia.html) at the Triffid in Brisbane alongside the earliest known performance of “Road Train”, making it one of the last songs from the album to be debuted live. It would be played throughout the year paired with “People-Vultures” like it is on the album, a role that it would loyally fulfill in the following years. The song vanished from 2017 to 2018, before coming back on [2019-10-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-1-2019-barrowland-glasgow-scotland.html) after [“Boogieman Sam.”](https://kglw.net/song/boogieman-sam) That said, the song would more often than not be paired with “People-Vultures” like it had in prior years. Occasionally “Mr. Beat” is given a unique live treatment.[2022-04-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-13-2022-arlington-theatre-santa-barbara-ca-usa.html) iss a notable version due to it being a standalone track in the set and an acoustic rendition as well.

Evil Death Roll
Mother nature can be a terrifying thing sometimes and in the world of crocodilians, nothing is more dangerous than the death roll. When a crocodile (or member of the crocodilia order) finds prey, they can latch on with their strong mouths and drag them underwater. Here they can perform the death roll, a series of rapid movements with one purpose: to kill. It’s a show of dominance and a strategic operation for food consumption and it’s nearly [universal in all crocodilians](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03949370.2019.1592231). The death roll is an animalistic, brutal way to go. Disorienting, dismembering, deadly. It’s the perfect topic for a wild *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* song. “Evil Death Roll” is a complex and heavy garage rock jam focusing on the butchery of the death roll. The song is referenced at the end of “Mr. Beat” where the main riff is played, and quotes the song [“Wah Wah”](https://kglw.net/song/wah-wah?artist_id=1) at 4:01. It also prominently features the main melody of [“Invisible Face”](https://kglw.net/song/invisible-face?artist_id=1) during the breakdown).

A demo of the song (first seen on the band’s [unannounced demo stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ge8A4pC6mE&t=295s) and released on *[Demos Vol. 1: Music To Kill Bad People To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-1)* shows the track in its earliest stages. While there are no lyrics, the main structure is there with a simple lineup of guitars, bass and drums. The only feature unique to the demo is its middle section which is reminiscent of Van Morrison’s 1970 song [“Moondance”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moondance_(Van_Morrison_song)), and features a riff similar to the verses of [“Lonely Steel Sheet Flyer.”](https://kglw.net/song/lonely-steel-sheet-flyer) The song’s earliest known performance was on [2015-5-30](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-may-30-2015-the-factory-theatre-sydney-australia.html) at The Factory Theatre in Sydney. While 2015 featured a handful of *Nonagon* songs in early stages, “Evil Death Roll” is probably the closest to the studio version out of the bunch. Then referred to as “Evil Devil,” its verses are mostly intact and the instrumental is all there, barring the demo’s jazz rock section and the quotes of “Robot Stop” and “Invisible Face” that would later be added. An early version of the song can be heard in the band’s documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=458s)*. The song was recorded at Brooklyn’s Daptone Records by Wayne Gordon. The song appeared in [promotional material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZyr128ww4U) for *Nonagon Infinity* in early 2016 and was released on that album on April 29th, 2016. A music video for the song was planned as part of the *Nonagon Infinity* film project but no info has been revealed about what it would have been. “Evil Death Roll” would later be released as the [first and only single](https://www.discogs.com/release/16140828-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Evil-Death-Roll-Live-In-San-Francisco-16) for *[Live In San Francisco ‘16](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-san-francisco-16). The song [later appeared](https://vgost.fandom.com/wiki/Gran_Turismo_Sport) on the soundtrack for the video game *[Gran Turismo Sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Turismo_Sport)*.

The song was played heavily in 2016 and continued to make consistent appearances throughout the following years, though it did slow down from 2017 to 2018. Around 2019 the line “let’s start killing things” began to change into “let’s start shooting things.” As the band entered their “jam era” in 2022/2023 the song began to wind into different territories, incorporating lighter sounding elements to the diabolical sound of the song and extending it beyond previous versions. In this time they began to skip the “Invisible Face” tease, abbreviating the song proper while making room for improvisation.

Invisible Face
The seventh song on *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* is an existential jam in 7/8 time, where Stu explains the facts of the universe — or at least the universe of the band’s music — as a machine altered by a powerful, all-knowing being, capable of changing it at whim. Paired with the fast, heavy yet complicated music, “Invisible Face” is a bit of a head scratcher. Yet it’s also a head scratcher for a few other reasons. While other *Nonagon Infinity* songs would be played throughout the years following its release, this track was dropped only a year after it was released, only to be dusted off years later. A majority of its early performances were incomplete. Despite this it got an entire music video which was released a whole year after the album’s promotional phase. What exactly happened here? Truth is, we don’t know, but here’s the rundown:


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h9WyVAH5XbM?si=bElEZzEQYo2z-E_U&amp;start=2344" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


Like many Gizzard tunes, “Invisible Face” was an instrumental early in its life. The one existing demo of the song (found on *[Demos Vol. 6: Music To Burn Money To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-6-music-to-burn-money-to)*) features the main riff played on piano and backed by drums, with other piano parts laid over it. The song’s middle section is absent from the demo as it stays on the main riff throughout. While most *Nonagon Infinity* songs were mainly recorded at one studio with vocals recorded by Michael Badger, “Invisible Face” was split between Daptone Records in Brooklyn and A Secret Location in Melbourne (recorded by Wayne Gordon and Paul Maybury respectively). According to an [article for Audio Technology](https://www.audiotechnology.com/features/king-gizzards-lo-fi-gut-feeling) the jazzy part of the song was done at A Secret Location with the main song presumably being a Daptone piece. The track was released on *Nonagon Infinity* released on April 29th, 2016. The melody of “Invisible Face” is prominently featured in [“Evil Death Roll”](https://kglw.net/song/evil-death-roll?artist_id=1) at the 4:01 mark with a change in pronoun (“I distort the notion of the place” is “you distort the notion of the place” instead).  “Invisible Face” also quotes [“Wah Wah”](https://kglw.net/song/wah-wah?artist_id=1) before transitioning into the song proper.

Despite being a more obscure *Nonagon* track, “Invisible Face” was given a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekXb74bUbRM) which was released on July 14th, 2017, announced by the band [tweeting a photo](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/885767257619443716?s=20) of it being uploaded to YouTube. It shows a team of seven cloaked men (as seen in the “Gamma Knife” and “People-Vultures” videos) flying through space with an alligator. They land on a planet and are hypnotized. The gator climbs the stalk of a strange plant and merges with it. This creates the egg previously seen in the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f78_Tf4Tdk) for [“People-Vultures.”](https://kglw.net/song/people-vultures?artist_id=1) As strange, alien plants begin to grow around the men, we cut to footage of the band sleeping, walking and drinking a red liquid from a giant jar. The film then cuts back to the animation where the crew is falling through space before cutting to a tease of the next song, “Wah Wah.” The video was created by a two-person team of Jason Galea and Joel Melrose with 16mm footage from Samuel Kristofski. While Galea edited and animated the video, Melrose was the one behind the illustrations seen in the video. The video was a part of the band’s Nonagon Infinity film project which never saw completion. Unlike the rest of the videos in the series, “Invisible Face" was released a whole year later between *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* and *[Sketches of Brunswick East])https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)*, making it the final *Nonagon Infinity* music video.

The live history of “Invisible Face” is a bit more strange than most songs in Gizzard’s repertoire. The earliest known performance was on [2016-5-9](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-may-9-2016-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-cleveland-oh-usa.html) at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. In these days the song was often a stepping stone into [“The River”](https://kglw.net/song/the-river) and was shorter, only going up to the first chorus at around a minute in length. There’s currently no proof that the song was played in its entirety during this time. To make matters worse, many live tapes accidentally mark the song as part of the setlist even though what is being noted is its tease in “Evil Death Roll.” That all said, the band had some interest in the idea of playing the song in its entirety. In a [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i89qei2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from May of 2022 Stu mentioned that it would be a good idea to play the song live and a year later “Invisible Face” made its true debut at The Salt Shed in Chicago, Illinois on [2023-6-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-12-2023-the-salt-shed-chicago-il-usa.html). This version of the song features the entire composition with its middle section being extended into a jam. After the final verse the song transitioned into “Wah Wah” and [“Road Train”](https://kglw.net/song/road-train?artist_id=1) the same way it does on the album. It would be played one more time at Remlinger Farms on [2023-06-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-18-2023-remlinger-farms-carnation-wa-usa.html) as part of a suite of “Invisible Face” > “Wah Wah” > “The River” > “Wah Wah” > “The River.”

Wah Wah
King Gizzard covered the topic of crying a few years before *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* with the Cook-led song appropriately titled [“Crying.”](https://kglw.net/song/crying) While he sang a simple tale of heartbreak, the band went a different way in 2016. “Wah Wah” is the most overtly satanic thing on *Nonagon Infinity* with images of hoofed beasts and bats from Hell. Instead of crying tears of sadness, this song is about tears of fear, pain and desperation. It’s also, in a way, a tribute to the wah-wah pedal — a guitar effect that features heavily both on this song and throughout King Gizzard’s discography. While not as iconic as other *Nonagon* tracks, “Wah Wah” is the occult core of the album, making it clear that the world King Gizzard presents isn’t just chaotic but demonic as well.


While *Nonagon Infinity* songs often had working titles, [“Wah Wah”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wah-Wah_(song)) always remained the same, though there were some ideas to change the title due to the George Harrison song of the same name. Stu [said to Flavorwire](https://www.flavorwire.com/573813/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-so-post-music-not-even-the-lead-singer-can-describe-it) “I’m a Harrison fan, so there was always that in the back of my head. The rough title was always ‘Wah Wah,’ because that’s kind of like what it keeps saying, and it keeps crying, and it’s got a wah pedal. So the rough title was always ‘Wah Wah.’ The whole time, I was worrying about changing the name, or changing the chorus, but it just never happened.” The earliest known performance of the song was at the Happy Dog in Cleveland, Ohio on [2015-06-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-14-2015-happy-dog-cleveland-oh-usa.html). The song appeared as the second in the show and was different from the studio version in a few ways, such as opening with Stu playing the main riff with some accompaniment on hi-hat before going to the first chorus. Early in their lifespans, most *Nonagon Infinity*had different, if not improvised lyrics. “Wah Wah” is nearly impossible to make out, with Stu seeming to fall on different noises and words to fit the melody. After this show it wouldn’t appear until ten days later on [2015-06-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-24-2015-babys-all-right-brooklyn-ny-usa-2.html) at Baby’s All Right in Brooklyn, NY. The solo intro is still there and the lyrics have started to settle in but have a distinct space setting compared to the demonic imagery to come (“you can see the Earth is moving, underneath the starship moving…”). The next performance would be two months later on [2015-08-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-28-2015-don-quixotes-international-music-hall-felton-ca-usa.html) and would be the last time played in 2018 to our knowledge. This version and some rehearsal footage would be included in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=458s)*. After an eighty show gap, “Wah Wah” would return at The Triffid in Brisbane on [2016-06-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-25-2016-the-triffid-brisbane-australia.html) next to its partner track “Road Train.” “Wah Wah” was mainly recorded at Daptone Records in Brooklyn by Wayne Gordon with vocals recorded by Michael Badger in his bungalow. It was released as part of *Nonagon Infinity* on April 28th, 2016. The song’s main riff is quoted at the end of [“Invisible Face”](https://kglw.net/song/invisible-face?artist_id=1) right before the song is fully played. It’s also the first in their discography to [feature zurna](https://www.flavorwire.com/573813/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-so-post-music-not-even-the-lead-singer-can-describe-it#:~:text=Cavs%20%5BMichael%20Cavanagh,his%20low%20ego.). 


Just like all songs on *Nonagon Infinity* it was meant to have a music video as part of the *Nonagon Infinity* movie that was never finished. We can see a remnant of the project in the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekXb74bUbRM) for “Invisible Face”, where the song’s title is spelled out in clay. According to a [post](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1o6ZY2pwHk/?img_index=2) on Jason Galea’s Instagram, the show poster for [2019-08-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-26-2019-lolympia-montreal-qc-canada.html) features shots from the video with the pixel art style being added on. While the video didn’t pan out, the song would reappear in the studio one final time during the intro of [“Acarine”](https://kglw.net/song/acarine), where the verse’s vocal melody is played on bass. Some have also noted its similarity to the melody of [“Butterfly 3000”](https://kglw.net/song/butterfly-3000) with some distinctions.

The track was paired frequently with [“Road Train”](https://kglw.net/song/road-train?artist_id=1) throughout 2016 as the band toured for *Nonagon Infinity*, and featured  teases of [“The River”](https://kglw.net/song/the-river) during most performances. Yet for as frequently as it was played, the band completely dropped the track in 2017, along with its follow-up song “Road Train.” It came back to the band’s repertoire on [2018-06-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-20-2018-variety-playhouse-atlanta-ga-usa.html) at the Variety Playhouse in Atlanta and was once again played extensively.  While the song would sometimes be paired with *Nonagon* material, it was also being paired with “The River.” In these versions “The River” would end after the second section and head into a mid-tempo groovy jam which would lead to the main riff of “Wah Wah.” Going into 2019 the song would be paired with “Road Train”, while also joining an iconic three song suite of “The River" > “Wah Wah” > “Road Train.” Other times the song would be played alone with a tease of “The River” at the beginning — though it often incorporated more teases at the end of the song. This rendition appeared in the 2020 concert film/album *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. The song would be played in both formations at two shows in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic would shut down the touring industry. That said, “Wah Wah” couldn’t be killed. On “Garage Rock Night” ([2021-12-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-22-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html)) during the band’s unfortunately incomplete Princess Theatre residency, the song returned as a standalone track, disappearing again until [2022-04-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-26-2022-gundlach-bundschu-winery-sonoma-ca-usa.html) at the Gundlach-Bundschu Winery in Sonoma, CA. By this point “Wah Wah” was anything they wanted it to be. It could be played on its own, it could be paired with a track, or it could be an important part of a three song suite. It could even be “The River” > “Wah Wah” > “The River” > “Wah Wah” > “Road Train” like on [2022-10-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-16-2022-masonic-temple-theatre-detroit-mi-usa.html). The song’s constantly changing placement continues to this day. On ]2023-06-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-12-2023-the-salt-shed-chicago-il-usa.html) the song was played after the first full performance of “Invisible Face,” making the album sequence of “Invisible Face” > “Wah Wah” > “Road Train.” While many of the *Nonagon* tracks have easy to guess sequences, you can never quite know with this song.

Road Train
There was a significant stretch in the band’s history when they didn’t make metal. Yet if there was any indication that this was a path they were capable of going down, it was “Road Train.” It is the ninth and final song on the band’s infinitely looping album *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)*, and is the bridge between the end and beginning. While not as heavy as future songs (such as [“The Great Chain of Being”](https://kglw.net/song/the-great-chain-of-being) a year later) its drums were distinctly intense and paired with the Mad Max-esque imagery of fuel guzzling trucks barrelling down roads in an apocalyptic wasteland. If you saw it live, you understood its power, especially between the two drummers. “Road Train” was as heavy as it got by 2016 Gizzard standards.


In an [ATO press release](https://atorecords.com/featured/pre-order-new-king-gizzard-album-nonagon-infinity-listen-to-gamma-knife-on-beats1/), Stu said the following of the song’s inspiration. “In the Australian desert, in the outback, there are what’s called road trains, which are these massive trucks pulling heaps of carriages that can end up being 50 meters long. They drive on the road really, really fast, and they’re deadly, with these bars in the front to kill kangaroos and anything else in their path.” “Road Train” ([initially titled “Motorhead Ending”](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-talk-infinitely-looping-concept-lp-187873/)) was recorded by Wayne Gordon at Daptone Records in Brooklyn, New York with vocals recorded by Michael Badger. The first appearance of the song was on the album *Nonagon Infinity* where it served as the final track which would send the listener back into [“Robot Stop.”](https://kglw.net/song/robot-stop?artist_id=1) On the vinyl version of the album it is given its own unique ending where we hear how the track connects to “Robot Stop.” When creating the cover for *Nonagon Infinity*, Jason Galea [originally envisioned the artwork to show a road train with a sword through its center](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnqxnog/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This artwork was later used on the [poster for Gizzard’s 2016 European tour](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/photos/a.173717175974527/1304282822917951/?type=3). Every song on *Nonagon Infinity* was meant to have a music video as part of the Nonagon Infinity movie project, though the video for “Road Train” was never finished, let alone described or hinted at.

While many of *Nonagon*’s songs were played at gigs upwards of a year before their release, “Road Train” was held back. According to an [interview with Eric](https://www.pancakesandwhiskey.com/2016/05/16/bowery-ballroom-bows-king-gizzard-lizard-wizard/) “Road Train” was a hard song to keep up with due to its heavy drumming. “We’re kind of still working out a few of the songs. Some of them are really hard to play live…” The earliest known performance of “Road Train” was on [2016-06-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-25-2016-the-triffid-brisbane-australia.html) at the Triffid in Brisbane;  the last song, along with [“Mr. Beat,”](https://kglw.net/song/mr-beat?artist_id=1) to be debuted from the album (not counting [“Invisible Face”](https://kglw.net/song/invisible-face?artist_id=1) and its full debut in 2023). Throughout the year, the song was used as a way to wrap back to “Robot Stop” at the end of the set, though sometimes they’d opt for 2014’s [“Hot Water”](https://kglw.net/song/hot-water) instead. A live version of “Road Train from 2016 was also included in a [promo for Gizzfest](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/videos/gizzfest-is-gonna-be-lit/1399413973404835/). In 2017 “Road Train” and its companion track [“Wah Wah”](https://kglw.net/song/wah-wah) disappeared from rotation. Unlike “Wah Wah” however, it would have to wait longer to get back into the spotlight. It wasn’t until [2018-10-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-october-9-2018-c3-stage-guadalajara-mexico.html) at the C3 Stage in Guadalajara that “Road Train” drove back in, once again leading into “Robot Stop'' after “Wah Wah.” It would continue to do that (occasionally without “Wah Wah'' such as on [2018-11-29](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-november-29-2018-the-tivoli-brisbane-australia.html)) until 2019. “Road Train” began to serve a new purpose: suite closer. That year the band began to play a three song run of [“The River”](https://kglw.net/song/the-river) > “Wah Wah” > “Road Train,” This sequence ended up at the beginning of the 2020 concert film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. There was no need to move into “Robot Stop” anymore and its original outro was scrapped. 2020 saw two performances of the song as “The River'' > “Wah Wah'' > “Road Train'' and “Wah Wah'' > “Road Train,'' but the song wouldn't reappear until after the pandemic on [2022-04-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-26-2022-gundlach-bundschu-winery-sonoma-ca-usa.html) at the Gundlach-Bundschu Winery in Sonoma, CA where it stood strong next to “Wah Wah.” Since then, the song has mostly been a closer for different suites though [2023-08-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-20-2023-festivalpark-kiewit-hasselt-belgium.html) proves there can be exceptions to the rule.

Flying Microtonal Banana
Rattlesnake
In the King Gizzard canon, few songs persist in popularity and relevance like “Rattlesnake,” the lead single from *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)* and the first true taste of the band’s microtonal explorations. It's one of the simplest songs on the album, focusing on an encounter with the serpent which ends with a deadly bite. The lyrics are repetitive and use only a few different phrases. To put it into perspective, Stu sings the title fifty-four times during its seven-minute runtime. The song itself is a droning, krautrock-inspired piece, with twisting guitar lines that often follow the vocal melody. The percussion on the song is also noteworthy — specifically the use of vibraslap which imitates the rattlesnake’s recognizable sound. The whistling of wind is also heard throughout, transporting the listener to a barren desert where the eponymous serpent lives. While not the first King Gizzard song to use microtones ([“Robot Stop”](https://kglw.net/song/robot-stop?artist_id=1) was the first released, the obscure [“Nonagon Intro Theme”](https://kglw.net/song/nonagon-intro-theme) was the first heard), “Rattlesnake” serves as an introduction to the new notes and tuning that define *Flying Microtonal Banana*, and by extension the band’s other microtonal works. It's one of the band’s most popular songs by a long shot. As of writing, its music video is both the most viewed video on the Flightless YouTube channel and the most viewed King Gizzard music video of all time. It's also one of the most played songs in the band’s discography with numerous high profile appearances at festivals and on live albums. The song won awards such as “best song at [The Age Music Victoria Awards](https://themusicnetwork.com/king-gizzard-ab-original-win-big-at-the-age-music-victoria-awards-2017/) and was named one of their ten best songs by [Guitar World](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/the-10-best-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-songs-so-far). The snake itself has appeared on concert posters (like [2021-12-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-21-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html) and [2023-06-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-7-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html)), album covers (*Flying Microtonal Banana*), and even in other songs such as [“The Land Before Timeland.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-land-before-timeland) The impact is not lost on the band. When [asked](https://kiyimuzik.com/interview-king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard/) what a hypothetical memorial stone for the band would look like, Stu said “I’d prefer it to just say ‘Rattlesnake, rattlesnake, rattlesnake…’ all over it. I’m just gonna say that. That’s gonna be our lasting legacy. Or just a single ‘Woo!’” That may be the greatest way to put it. With its repetitive, violent lyrics, unusual experimentation, iconic music video and incredible live reputation, “Rattlesnake” has a solid spot in the band’s ever-growing discography and has proven itself to be an essential part of the band’s legacy.

Two quotes from the band have circulated across the internet, although it's unclear where they originated. Stu reportedly explained that the song was a way to introduce an audience unfamiliar with microtonality to the new notes and scales found throughout *Flying Microtonal Banana*. “The logic was that the song is so repetitive that by the end of it your ears are adjusted to the microtones, you may be on our wavelength.” Joey adds onto this by saying, “It’s annoying at the start then by the time you get to the end or maybe listen a couple times, it’s just in ya and you can’t escape it.” The earliest tease of what was to come was on November 17th, 2016 when the band [posted a video](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1393517877327778) of them rehearsing the song for the then upcoming Gizzfest. On September 29th, 2016, Joey posted a video of him playing microtonal guitar in front of a green screen masked out to show a football stadium. The caption read, “Finally got the call up to play half time at the granny. Sound coming soon.” A day later the band posted a [photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/BLABVPXg-W3/) of them in front of a green screen with the caption being three banana emojis. Months passed and on November 10th the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-i1XZc8ZwA) for “Rattlesnake” was put on YouTube. Created by Jason Galea, it shows the band playing in front of a green screen that depicts 3D animated desert wastelands covered with toxic waste as well as strange fortresses with skull-shaped entrances. The band is sometimes morphed and changed in various ways. Stu is given reptilian eyes at points, while Ambrose is shrunk down to less than a foot in height and plays around. Stu [later called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i88ow32/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) one of his favorite videos to make. A [single](https://www.discogs.com/master/2039134-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Rattlesnake) for the song was released at the same time of the video. While the digital single contains the song in its entirety, a [UK promotional CD](https://www.discogs.com/release/9809171-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Rattlesnake) has a radio edit at only three minutes and thirty-three seconds in length.

The song would make its live debut on [2016-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2016-the-marquee-rna-showgrounds-brisbane-australia.html) at the RNA Showgrounds for Gizzfest Brisbane where it appeared as a show closer. The only other performances of the song that year were for Gizzfest Melbourne on [2016-11-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-26-2016-coburg-velodrome-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) and Gizzfest Sydney on [2016-11-29](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-29-2016-big-top-luna-park-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html). These versions were shorter than the studio version, with cut or shortened sections, but were fairly close otherwise. In 2017 the song remained in the band’s regular rotation and by 2018 it became a set opener, though was moved towards the back of the sets later on.  A Banana-less performance from [2018-08-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-11-2018-alter-reitplatz-haldern-germany.html) was featured in *[THE NONAGON MOVIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV8knE56GE4&t=388s)*. To put things in perspective, there were at least one hundred forty-five performances from [2017-01-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-january-21-2017-the-meadow-singapore-singapore.html) to the end of 2018. Despite its place in the band’s live shows, it was played less in 2019 but was still in the band’s regular rotation. Part of the song’s performance from [2019-10-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-5-2019-alexandra-palace-london-england.html) was included in the film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* as part of [“A Brief History Of Planet Earth.”](https://kglw.net/song/a-brief-history-of-planet-earth?artist_id=1) After one pre-COVID pandemic performance on [2020-02-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-8-2020-footscray-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) it returned on [2021-02-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-24-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) for the band’s microtonal shows for *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)* and *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)*. It was played at six microtonal shows that year. The biggest change to the live performances of “Rattlesnake” came in 2022. As the band went in a “jam band” direction, the song was stretched out longer than the studio version. These versions could reach up to fourteen minutes in length and appeared as both show openers and closers, with some gigs seeing it paired up with tracks like [“Automation”](https://kglw.net/song/automation?artist_id=1) and [“Honey.”](https://kglw.net/song/honey?artist_id=1) Since the start of their 2022 shows, this has been the go-to rendition for the band.

Melting
Throughout King Gizzard’s discography, the threat of climate change is made apparent. Whether it's in the mellow acoustics of *[Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](https://kglw.net/discography/paper-mache-dream-balloon)*, or the raging metal of *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)*, the band stresses that humanity’s greed and apathy is dooming the planet. Typically this message is paired with another concept or story, but with “Melting” the band is as blatant as possible. In its lyrics, Stu says that global warming is a threat larger than terrorism or viruses and that our words mean nothing if we can’t back them up with action. Conversation is meaningless when the world we live in won’t be around for our children. In a sense, “Melting” is the band’s environmental manifesto, describing bluntly how they feel about the dangers that face mankind. The message is backed up by a percussion-heavy instrumental with some of the wildest riffs on the entire album. Part bossa nova, part Anatolian rock, but always distinctly Gizz. 


The song was released as the second track on *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)* on February 24th, 2017. For a time, the track [“Scared Of Christmas”](https://kglw.net/song/scared-of-christmas?artist_id=1) was thought to be a demo for the song, though this was disproved with the release of *[Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2)*.

“Melting” is the rarest of the *Flying Microtonal Banana* songs. The first known performance of the song was on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne). It was played one other time in 2019 on [2019-07-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-6-2019-unsw-roundhouse-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html) at the UNSW Roundhouse in Eora (Sydney). One of these performances appears in the documentary *[RATTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AzPaId5Qc&t=1272s)*. It wouldn’t be played again until the band’s microtonal shows in 2021 starting with [2021-04-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-21-2021-unibar-university-of-wollongong-wollongong-nsw-australia.html), moving to a performance on [2021-04-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-22-2021-enmore-theatre-eora-sydney-australia.html) and ending with [2021-12-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-20-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html). The song is typically longer live than it is on *Flying Microtonal Banana*.

Open Water
One of the most rhythmic and hypnotic tracks on *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)* is “Open Water.” Starting with intense double drumming from Cavs and Eric, it features wah wah electric guitars and fast repeating riffs which keeps the track constantly moving. The lyrics (sung by Stu) follow a sailor drowning alone in the middle of the sea. They begin to give in to the water as they realize there’s no help on the way, and are taken into the depths by a [Kraken](https://www.wired.com/2014/09/fantastically-wrong-legend-of-the-kraken/) who grabs them by the leg. In the end they’re destined for a burial under the waves. The story is reminiscent of sailors’ tales from the 1700s though its reference to the “height of the sea” and a disappearing shore may put the song in a modern context as climate change [raises the sea level](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level).

Recording sessions for the song at Flightless HQ are featured prominently in the documentary *[Peeling the Flying Microtonal Banana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=170Z9qBjfkI)*. It was released on February 24th, 2017.

The earliest known performance of “Open Water” was on [2017-03-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-19-2017-the-night-cat-melbourne-australia.html) at The Night Cat in Melbourne. Throughout the spring of 2017, the song regularly opened up the band’s shows. It was played a handful of times in June (with “Rattlesnake” now taking its place) and then disappeared for the rest of the year. The band brought it back on [2018-02-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-18-2018-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) and  played it throughout spring before returning for a few dates in June. Up to this point the song appeared close to the studio version, though this would change in 2019. That year “Open Water” was played significantly less (only six performances) but was given a drum solo by Cavs and Eric. One of these drum solos from [2019-10-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-8-2019-ancienne-belgique-brussels-belgium.html) was included in the film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* as the track [“Parking.”](https://kglw.net/song/parking?artist_id=1) After one appearance in 2020 on [2020-02-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-8-2020-footscray-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) (the final performance of the track with Eric), it returned on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) for the band’s fully microtonal shows. While these removed the drum solo, the song was given a new feel with Cavs doing double bass drumming throughout, making for a heavier rendition of the track. This version was ditched in 2022 as the band went to a jam-centric take on the studio version. Outside of the band’s gigs, Cavs played the song briefly during his [drum seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9O9b-U0nl4&t=1381s) at Drumtek in Northcote.

Sleep Drifter
In “Sleep Drifter,” Stu sings about being sleepy while touring but finding this state of hypnagogia pleasant as it allows him to imagine he’s next to his partner. Starting with a descending microtonal riff, we’re greeted with a mellow but steady verse with highlighted harmonica, intricate guitar riffs, and a driving rhythm. The song largely sticks within this krautrock-inspired rhythm but adds a long outro where the band is allowed space to improvise. “Sleep Drifter” captures that transitional space between being awake and being asleep, though in a live setting the band transformed the track into a high energy jam with whole new sections of improv.


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFIZEHSmMaw?si=pFmP2Cd52P4X8GpL&amp;start=2002" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


[Some have theorized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BbC2M7NIEg&t=41s) that “Sleep Drifter” was based on the song [“Kara Toprak”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pK_ONcNEUgM) by Turkish ashik Âşık Veysel, though this has not been confirmed by the band. That said, [Stu originally intended](https://www.loudandquiet.com/interview/how-and-why-king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-released-5-albums-in-2017/) for [Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana) to be a Turkish folk album based around bağlama, though this proved to be too difficult for the band. Two demos for “Sleep Drifter” have been released. The first is on *[Demos Vol. 3: Music To Eat Pond Scum To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-3)*. Coming in at two minutes and eighteen seconds in length, this barebones version skips the intro and outro and extends the verses. The song is played faster than the final version, with only guitar and drums present. The second demo was put on *[Demos Vol. 4: Music To Die To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-4)* and features a full band lineup and a much longer runtime. This track features two different pieces of the song. The first part is played slower than the first demo, with a pace and  structure generally closer to the *Flying Microtonal Banana* rendition. The second part is a jam reminiscent of the outro from the studio version. Between their performances they talk about how to start the takes and how the song will fade into its outro. “Sleep Drifter” was released as a [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XW8yofuGao) on January 17th, 2017 and was the first song King Gizzard released that year. In February a [sampler](https://www.discogs.com/release/10037158-Various-Remote-Control-February-Sampler-2017) for the label Remote Control featured a radio edit of the song that hasn’t been made available elsewhere. The song saw a release on *Flying Microtonal Banana* on February 24th, 2017.

The first known performance of “Sleep Drifter” happened on [2017-01-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-january-21-2017-the-meadow-singapore-singapore.html) at The Meadow in Singapore. Throughout the year the song remained in their lineup but featured a different composition than the studio version. Rather than starting with the descending riff, the band improvised on different parts of the songs for about two and a half minutes before going into the song proper before gradually slowing to a crawl at the song’s ending. These versions were significantly longer, usually passing the five-minute mark. The band would continue to play this version throughout the following year. A Banana-less performance of “Sleep Drifter” from [2018-08-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-5-2018-macka-kckciftlik-park-istanbul-turkey.html) was featured in the video *[ПАДАЮЩИЙ СНЕГ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4Nqfbuqke8&t=45s)*. Live versions of the song from that year (such as [2018-06-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-20-2018-variety-playhouse-atlanta-ga-usa.html)) also inspired the K.G. track [“Honey.”](https://kglw.net/song/honey?artist_id=1) In 2019 the band simplified the track and played it close to the studio version, though they cut the outro entirely. While the song was not played in 2020, it returned for the band’s microtonal shows in 2021. Here the song was paired with “Honey” for a medley of “Sleep Drifter” > “Honey.” The band would continue to play this in the following years, though they would also change it up with some shows using the song in conjunction with other tracks like [“Billabong Valley”](https://kglw.net/song/billabong-valley?artist_id=1) (see [2022-08-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-5-2022-divadlo-archa-prague-czechia.html)). Other times, “Sleep Drifter” was played on its own (see [2022-06-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-6-2022-razzmatazz-2-barcelona-spain.html)). As the band began to jam more and more past 2022, the song was extended with some performances, such as [2023-08-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-14-2023-palp-festival-verbier-switzerland.html) reaching nearly ten minutes in length.

Billabong Valley
“Billabong Valley” details the life of the infamous bushranger [Daniel Morgan](https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/morgan-daniel-dan-13109). Over his life, Morgan was involved in a number of crimes including robbery and murder in northern Victoria, often targeting authority figures such as sergeants and police. On the morning of April 9th, 1865, Morgan was shot dead by John Wendlan before being mutilated and decapitated. His story was later immortalized in the 1976 film *[Mad Dog Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Dog_Morgan)*, directed by Phillippe Mora and starring Dennis Hopper. The song bases itself on the movie through the use of the name “Mad Dog Morgan” — a name which was created for the film. It also mentions real life events, such as the [destruction of a camp in Kyeamba](https://aguidetoaustralianbushranging.com/2023/01/15/spotlight-morgans-outrage-at-kyamba-16-january-1865/). In the band’s [2022 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/king_gizzard_ama_gatherum_all/), Ambrose said, “The story is about the Aussie bushranger Mad Dog Morgan. He would hide out in [a] place called the Billabong Valley. Savage sucker he was.” The song itself is a rocking microtonal track fitting for the violent, action-packed life of the outlaw, though it does slow down to a climactic end. The backing track is typical for *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)*, though the use of zurna and microtones contrasts with (even adds flair to) the song’s distinctly Australian story. “Billabong Valley” is also the only track on *Flying Microtonal Banana* sung primarily by Ambrose.

Some of the creative process behind “Billabong Valley” was revealed by Ambrose during the band’s previously mentioned Reddit AMA. “Stu had the tune going and asked me to sing on it cause I think at the time he thought my voice might have suited it better? I do remember Cavs asking me if the lyric 'faster than a stolen' was actually 'loaded gun'. Should've changed it to that but it was too late.” The studio version is out of tune as it was slightly sped up on tape. It saw a release on February 24th, 2017.

The earliest known performance of the song was on [2017-03-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-19-2017-the-night-cat-melbourne-australia.html) at The Night Cat in Naarm (Melbourne). Throughout 2017 the song was in the band’s regular rotation. These performances were longer than the studio version, with improvisation during the intro and break. The song would also contain a unique lineup change, with Ambrose and Stu switching instruments. Ambrose played the Flying Microtonal Banana while Stu took over on keys. This would continue throughout the following years. It was played a bunch in 2018, with a Banana-less performance from [2018-08-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-5-2018-macka-kckciftlik-park-istanbul-turkey.html) appearing in *[ПАДАЮЩИЙ СНЕГ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4Nqfbuqke8&t=45s)*. It remained a common track in 2019 before falling off of setlists in 2020. It returned for the band’s microtonal shows in 2021 and returned to the regular rotation afterwards, though it's less prominent than it was before the release of *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)* and *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)* The song is typically played as a standalone piece though it has been paired with [“Sleep Drifter,”](https://kglw.net/song/sleep-drifter?artist_id=1) like on [2022-08-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-5-2022-divadlo-archa-prague-czechia.html).

Anoxia
In “Anoxia,” Joey sings about raging fires and anoxia, a technical term for a complete lack of oxygen (not to be confused with hypoxia, which is low levels of oxygen). The verses tell of someone feeling the heat from bushfires and how they’re suffocating as the oxygen is taken by the flames. The second verse details the narrator and their significant other evacuating as the heat becomes comparable to the sun. The narrator remarks that they want to become fully aquatic as the oxygen levels are slowly depleted, and that they hope a road to the ocean is burned for them through the wilderness. The choruses are more bleak however, describing a family in a football field who had suffocated because of the catastrophe. The lyrics find a dark irony in the fact that even though they escaped the fire, they still passed away anyway. A sourceless quote from Joey taken from the [song’s Genius page](https://genius.com/King-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-anoxia-lyrics) seems to explain the track’s inspiration. “I remember reading this story around the [Black Saturday fires](https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/black-saturday-bushfires) where people that were found in the centre of football ovals without a single burn or mark on them. What happens is the fire is so intense it sucks all of the oxygen out of the air… I thought there was a weird, not-beauty in it, but it’s an interesting phenomenon. Kind of morbid…” The song itself shares some similarities to the work of Neil Young with Joey going as far as to say that it was his “Neil Young impersonation song” on [2022-10-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-18-2022-history-toronto-on-canada.html). “Anoxia” has the unique distinction of being the only track on *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)* to feature lead vocals from Joey. It was released on February 24th, 2017.

The song was played often throughout 2017 and 2018, though it was played in a lower key and typically faster than the studio version. It was played less throughout 2019 and wasn’t even played in 2020. Since then it has reappeared a few times a year, becoming a rare track from Joey.

Doom City
Starting with muffled wah wah guitar in 3/4 time, “Doom City” explodes into a high energy microtonal rock song with cackling zurna and evil laughter, while the lyrics describe a city dominated by pollution. The contaminated air is the result of a godlike figure whose breath covers the area in a dangerous fog, destroying the narrator’s lungs. While his actions are no doubt harmful, the god finds humor in humanity’s suffering. The god in the song is not explicitly defined, though he’s described as “in [Empyrean](https://danteworlds.laits.utexas.edu/paradiso/10empyrean.html)”, referring to the celestial sphere known for fire and light where Dante met God in Paradiso. Perhaps the god within “Doom City” is God himself. Genius annotations claim that in a [now lost Triple J interview](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/review/album/s4622689.htm) Stu mentioned that the song was inspired by a trip to Beijing, a city that had gained a reputation for its suffocating air quality. While the verses are a rhythmic 4/4 passage, the choruses revert back to the sinister 3/4 time signature of the intro while adding a doom metal influence, making for one of the heaviest sections on all of *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)*. It was released on February 24th, 2017.

It would be played heavily throughout 2017 and given the “doom” outro of [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1) late that year. While it continued to be played often in 2018, the song slowly dropped off of sets in 2019. While it didn’t appear in 2020, it returned in 2021 for the band’s microtonal shows. Up to this point “Doom City” was primarily played as a standalone track. In 2022 this began to change, as “Doom City” began to be used as the start of a medley alongside tracks like [“O.N.E.”](https://kglw.net/song/o-n-e?artist_id=1) ([2022-03-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-7-2022-enmore-theatre-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html)) and [“Minimum Brain Size”](https://kglw.net/song/minimum-brain-size?artist_id=1) ([2022-10-31](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-31-2022-the-criterion-oklahoma-city-ok-usa.html)). The song is played close to the studio track with no major alterations.

Nuclear Fusion
“Nuclear Fusion” can be described as groovy, dark and intricate. The song has some of the most peculiar features of any song on *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)*. Slowed down parts appear throughout while the drums go from playing in sync with each other to splitting up for the choruses, the beat bouncing back and forth in stereo. The riffs are layered with hammer-ons and rhythmic palm muting throughout, creating a fluid and infectious swing. The lyrics are also layered with meaning. The song starts by focusing on the stars in the sky before looking at them at an atomic level. [Nuclear fusion](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-is-nuclear-fusion) is the process of atomic nuclei combining to create one source which exerts a massive amount of energy. This process is how stars such as our Sun produce all their energy. The second verse describes someone dying in the ocean only for their spirit to travel upwards through the cosmic radiation, becoming one with the atoms that created the stars. The chorus points out this connection by arguing that life is intrinsically tied to the universe and thereby the atoms in it, so much so that we’re “essentially one being.” We’re all the products of nuclear fusion. The song was released as a [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MFVhqcRpN4) on December 21st, 2016 and was included on *Flying Microtonal Banana* on February 24th, 2017.

The first known performance of “Nuclear Fusion” was on [2017-1-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-january-21-2017-the-meadow-singapore-singapore.html) at The Meadow in Singapore. It was played at least five other times before the release of *Flying Microtonal Banana*. Following February 2017, “Nuclear Fusion” became a commonly played track all the way through 2018. In 2019 the song was played a bit less but remained in the band’s roster. While not played in 2020, it returned on [2021-02-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-24-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) with two changes. With Eric’s departure, the track’s rhythm was left to Cavs who played it straight, unlike the split beat on the original. Outside of this change, Joey’s parts were altered. Up to this point Joey throat-sang the pitched down phrase at the beginning of the track (sometimes with pitch shifting), but due to the harsh nature of throat singing, decided that other members of the band should give it a shot to spice things up. The first one picked by Joey was Cavs, who attempted to sing it through his hi-hat mic, though it either didn’t happen or wasn’t audible. The following two shows didn’t feature any vocals from the band for that section and instead went straight to Lucas’ bass part (see [2021-03-31](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-31-2021-thebarton-theatre-adelaide-australia.html) for a good example). The band gave it another shot on [2021-04-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-22-2021-enmore-theatre-eora-sydney-australia.html) when Joey picked Ambrose to do the part, leading to a shrill scream of the title. Cook did the following performance on [2021-04-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-23-2021-riverstage-brisbane-australia.html), while Joey reprised his part for Microtonal Night on [2021-12-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-21-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html). Since then the role has changed in each city, ranging from band members ([2022-10-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-24-2022-rabbit-rabbit-asheville-nc-usa.html)) to fans in the audience ([2023-06-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-11-2023-the-salt-shed-chicago-il-usa.html)). In a live setting the song is played close to the record, but is missing a few elements such as the post chorus fill at 1:53 (replaced with the simpler fill from 3:04), the bass section at 3:22 as well as the pitched-down outro.

Flying Microtonal Banana
Closing out *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)* is the title track that leans heavily into the Turkish roots of the album. It’s a short instrumental focused on a zurna melody, which is followed by a simple ascending guitar riff before leaving the listener in blowing winds. The song would reappear subtly on *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)* as part of its intro [“K.G.L.W.”](https://kglw.net/song/kglw-intro?artist_id=1) [According to Stu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODI0x2unT2Q) the song is played in reverse at the start of the track to create a link between the two albums. It saw a release on February 24th, 2017.


“Flying Microtonal Banana” has never been played live.
Murder of the Universe
A New World
Opening *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)*, and its first chapter, “The Tale of the Altered Beast,” is a short track called “A New World.” Starting with eerie synthesizers and followed by a burst of electric guitars, the song sets the stage for the album’s darker themes and music. The track is narrated by Leah Senior, who describes the thoughts of someone remembering the story to come after waking up covered in blood and dirt. Stu described “The Tale of the Altered Beast” in an [interview for Observer](https://observer.com/2017/04/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-interview/). “‘Tale of the Altered Beast’ is the first one. It chronicles a human person being stalked by an Altered Beast, which is kind of a distorted half-creature, half-human, which we can maybe all relate to. Eventually the person is consumed by the beast and becomes the beast himself, goes on to cause more havoc, create more beasts, then he dies. It sounds familiar, you know?”

The video *[A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ4c2v6qTY4&t=120s)* opens with the band recording the song at Flightless HQ. According to their [whiteboard](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-released-five-albums-in-a-single-year-198057/), the song was initially called “Intro.” The song also appeared in [promotional material](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1502309306448634) for *Murder of the Universe*, which was released on June 23rd, 2017. A music video for “The Tale of the Altered Beast” was planned but never finished with footage making its way into promotional material and *A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH*.


Despite being released in 2017, “A New World” saw its live debut on [2022-10-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-5-2022-pne-forum-vancouver-canada.html) at the PNE Forum in Vancouver and would be played three times in 2022 — all of them with Leah Senior doing narration. The song would see two appearances in 2023, this time as an instrumental. One of these from [2023-03-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-23-2023-troxy-london-england.html) would see the song in a rare combination: “A New World” > [“Altered Beast III”](https://kglw.net/song/altered-beast-iii?artist_id=1) > [“Alter Me III”](https://kglw.net/song/alter-me-iii?artist_id=1) > [“Altered Beast IV.”](https://kglw.net/song/altered-beast-iv?artist_id=1)

Altered Beast I
The first of the “Altered Beast” tracks, “Altered Beast I” follows someone who encounters a hybrid creature described as “half made of man, half of bear.” The spectator is both frightened and intrigued by the beast and watches it approach.

A demo for the song was released as part of *[Demos Vol. 4: Music To Die To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-4)*. In it, we hear a stripped back instrumental version close to the studio release. The only major difference is the riff of [“Altered Beast IV”](https://kglw.net/song/altered-beast-iv?artist_id=1) at 1:34. Other early versions of the song can be heard in *[A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ4c2v6qTY4&t=350s)*. The song was released as part of *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* on June 23rd, 2017. A music video for “The Tale of the Altered Beast” was planned but never finished with footage making its way into promotional material and *A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH*.

The song’s first reported performance was on [2017-04-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-18-2017-paradise-pool-at-hard-rock-hotel-las-vegas-nv-usa.html) at the Paradise Pool at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. It wouldn’t be played regularly until May of 2018 when the song was played after [“Alter Me I”](https://kglw.net/song/alter-me-i?artist_id=1) — reversed from the track listing of *Murder of the Universe*. This continued going into June, with the song even coming out of [“Cellophane.”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane?artist_id=1) The song would appear in its “Alter Me I” > “Altered Beast I” form going into 2019 though [2019-07-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-4-2019-the-tivoli-brisbane-qld-australia.html) saw the album sequence of “Altered Beast I” > “Alter Me I” > [“Altered Beast II.”](https://kglw.net/song/altered-beast-ii?artist_id=1) The song took a break before and after the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and returned on [2022-10-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-5-2022-pne-forum-vancouver-canada.html) as part of the story’s opening sequence from [“A New World”](https://kglw.net/song/a-new-world?artist_id=1) to “Altered Beast II.” The band played it in sequence (even adding “Alter Me II” and “Altered Beast III” on [2022-10-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-11-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html)) on a few dates in 2022, all of which featured Leah Senior providing narration. In 2023 the band returned to narration-less versions, but kept it in its original order.

Alter Me I
Despite the narrator’s terror at seeing an Altered Beast, deep inside there’s a desire to be changed into one. “Alter Me I”, the first of the “Alter Me” songs, is short and to the point with a simple demand to be altered.


In the making of the video *[A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ4c2v6qTY4&t=350s)* the band is seen rehearsing the song at 4:23 (of course without any narration). For the release of *[Murder of the Universe[(https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* (June 23rd, 2017), “Alter Me I” appeared in [promotional material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hNpTgBMswc) uploaded to their social media. A music video for “The Tale of the Altered Beast” was planned but never finished with footage making its way into promotional material and *A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH*.


The first reported performance of “Alter Me I” happened on [2017-01-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-january-21-2017-the-meadow-singapore-singapore.html) at The Meadow in Singapore. Throughout 2017 the song was used to introduce a medley of “The Tale of the Altered Beast” before leading to [“Altered Beast II.”](https://kglw.net/song/altered-beast-ii?artist_id=1) In 2018 the song was mostly used to open [“Altered Beast I”](https://kglw.net/song/altered-beast-i?artist_id=1), though occasionally appeared in its album sequence. In 2019 this flipped with the song returning to its “Alter Me I” > “Altered Beast II” transition, with a few appearances of the “Alter Me I” > “Altered Beast I” rendition. After a long break before and after the pandemic, the song returned, starting with [2022-10-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-5-2022-pne-forum-vancouver-canada.html) for a few performances once again in original order — all with Leah Senior narration. In 2023 the song returned for a couple of shows once again without narration. As of writing, “Alter Me I” is the most played of all the “Tale of the Altered Beast” tracks.

Altered Beast II
The beast has now approached the song’s protagonist and its power is on full display. However, beyond the physical damage an altered beast could cause, it speaks of how it desires to take over the human’s body and to live in their head. With a distinct 9/8 rhythm and riff akin to Dave Brubeck’s [“Blue Rondo à la Turk”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Rondo_%C3%A0_la_Turk) “Altered Beast II” is one of, if not the most well known, part of “The Tale of the Altered Beast.”

In *[A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ4c2v6qTY4&t=350s)* the band is seen recording the song at Flightless HQ alongside live footage of the band playing the track. This footage would also appear in a [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hNpTgBMswc) for *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)*, which was released on June 23rd, 2017. A music video for “The Tale of the Altered Beast” was planned but never finished with footage making its way into promotional material and *A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH*.

The first known performance of “Altered Beast II” was on [2017-01-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-january-21-2017-the-meadow-singapore-singapore.html) and it would be played heavily throughout 2017 in its usual album placement between [“Alter Me I”](https://kglw.net/song/alter-me-i?artist_id=1) and [“Alter Me II”](https://kglw.net/song/alter-me-ii?artist_id=1) for a medley of “Altered Beast.” In 2018 this was shortened to just “Alter Me I” and “Altered Beast II.” This continued into 2019 with a new medley of [“Altered Beast I”](https://kglw.net/song/altered-beast-i?artist_id=1) > “Alter Me I” > “Altered Beast II” also appearing. The song wouldn’t be seen again until [2022-10-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-5-2022-pne-forum-vancouver-canada.html) and would appear a few times in album order with narration from Leah Senior. In 2023 the song returned to its 2019 form. As of writing, “Altered Beast II” is the most played of the four “Altered Beast” tracks.
Alter Me II
Cornered by the beast, the protagonist is about to meet their fate — elaborated on in [“Altered Beast III.”](https://kglw.net/song/altered-beast-iii?artist_id=1) Like all “Alter Me” tracks, “Alter Me II” is a short and simple transitional track released as part of *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* on June 23rd, 2017. A music video for “The Tale of the Altered Beast” was planned but never finished with footage making its way into promotional material and *[A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ4c2v6qTY4&t=350s)*. 


The first known performance of “Alter Me II” was on [2016-12-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-december-9-2016-meredith-supernatural-amphitheatre-meredith-australia.html) at the Merideth Music Festival, making it the first “Alter Me” to be played live. Throughout 2017 the song was in heavy rotation appearing where it does on the album between [“Altered Beast II”](https://kglw.net/song/altered-beast-ii?artist_id=1) and “Altered Beast III.” Despite this, it dropped off of setlists almost entirely in 2018, with only a few appearances that summer. Since then it has been rarely played though it has seen some changes. In 2019 the song was occasionally played as “Alter Me II” > [“Altered Beast III”](https://kglw.net/song/altered-beast-iii?artist_id=1) and in 2022 it returned with narration from Leah Senior.

Altered Beast III
After yearning to be one, our protagonist finally begins the process of becoming an Altered Beast. With white teeth and fur covered body, the Altered Beast devours the human, leading to their rebirth. While sonically similar to the rest of the “Altered Beast” tracks, “Altered Beast III” features a unique “doom metal” section as well as call and response vocals from Stu. The song was released on *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* on June 23rd, 2017.

Footage of the band recording and rehearsing “Altered Beast III” can be found in *[A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ4c2v6qTY4&t=350s)*. Interestingly, writing on the wall behind Cavs seems to indicate that the song was split in two parts when creating the track — most likely the main body and the “doom” section at 1:27. The song was released on *Murder of the Universe* on June 23rd, 2017. A music video for “The Tale of the Altered Beast” was planned but never finished with footage making its way into promotional material and *A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH*.

The song was played often in 2017, usually as the end of a medley of “Altered Beast” material,though some shows did see it go into [“Alter Me III.”](https://kglw.net/song/alter-me-iii?artist_id=1) The song was only played a few times in 2018, mostly in it’s album sequence although [2018-10-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-13-2018-moreno-beach-perris-ca-usa.html) saw a rare [“Alter Me I”](https://kglw.net/song/alter-me-i?artist_id=1) > “Altered Beast III.” In 2019 the song was occasionally played as [“Alter Me II”](https://kglw.net/song/alter-me-ii?artist_id=1) > “Altered Beast III” and in 2022 it returned with narration provided by Leah Senior.

Alter Me III
After our protagonist transforms, they lose more and more of their previous self — replaced by a killer. “Alter Me III” is another straightforward track and the final “Alter Me” in “The Tale of the Altered Beast.” The song was released on *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* on June 23rd, 2017. A music video for “The Tale of the Altered Beast” was planned but never finished with footage making its way into promotional material and *A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH*.


The earliest known performance of “Alter Me III” was on [2017-06-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-13-2017-concorde-2-brighton-england.html) at the Concorde in Brighton. It was played throughout the year as part of live performances of “The Tale of the Altered Beast” that stayed true to its album placement. While played often that year, it saw a steep drop off in appearances in 2018 — appearing only once on [2018-08-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-7-2018-store-vega-copenhagen-denmark.html). In 2019 it was played more frequently, often as part of a short combo of “Alter Me III” > [“Altered Beast IV”](https://kglw.net/song/altered-beast-iv?artist_id=1) though it wouldn’t return to 2017 numbers. Since then it has made a few appearances with 2022 performances featuring Leah Senior providing narration. As of writing, “Alter Me III” is the least played of the “Altered Beast” tracks.

Altered Beast IV
After their transformation, our protagonist is satisfied with their newfound power and body, feeling that they can live this life of cruelty forever. However, while happy for a time, they begin to realize that there’s an emptiness inside that cannot be fixed through more bloodshed. They have lived out their cruel fantasies but now have no emotional response. Accompanied by an 11/16 rhythm, grand choruses and mind-bending, repetitive passages sung by Stu, “Altered Beast IV” is the final “Altered Beast.” The song was released on *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* on June 23rd, 2017.

At the end of the demo for [“Altered Beast I”](https://kglw.net/song/altered-beast-i?artist_id=1) found on *[Demos Vol. 4: Music To Die To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-4)*, the intro riff from the final version of IV is heard. In the documentary *[A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ4c2v6qTY4&t=350s)* we see the band recording the song at Flightless HQ. On the wall behind Cavs is a bunch of writing for the album structure. Within the writings is a quick note that “Altered Beast IV” would be created in two parts. This could be marking the main part of the song and the “Alter Me” reprise at 4:10. A music video for “The Tale of the Altered Beast” was planned but never finished with footage making its way into promotional material and *A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH*.

Based on available data “Altered Beast IV” was first played on [2017-09-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-23-2017-district-square-kalamazoo-mi-usa.html) as part of the Audiotree Music Festival. The song would be played throughout the end of 2017 in its album placement next to [“Alter Me III”](https://kglw.net/song/alter-me-iii?artist_id=1) during medleys of “The Tale of the Altered Beast” — though these performances never transitioned into the next album track [“Life/Death.”](https://kglw.net/song/life-death?artist_id=1) Following many performances, it was very rarely played by the band in 2018, with one known performance on [2018-08-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-7-2018-store-vega-copenhagen-denmark.html). In 2019 the song was played a few times in the pairing of “Alter Me III” > “Altered Beast IV”, and in 2022 it would be played with narration from Leah Senior. As of writing, “Altered Beast IV” is the least played of the “Altered Beast” tracks.

Life/Death
After losing their passion for cruelty by exchanging their humanity, the Altered Beast dies — soundtracked by spooky synthesizer parts in a 9/8 rhythm. The title is arguably referenced in [“Murder of the Universe.”](https://kglw.net/song/murder-of-the-universe?artist_id=1) While most of the songs from *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* were written out on the band’s [studio whiteboard](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-released-five-albums-in-a-single-year-198057/) at Flightless HQ, “Life/Death” was missing from the Altered Beast suite. It was released on June 23rd, 2017. A music video for “The Tale of the Altered Beast” was planned but never finished with footage making its way into promotional material and *A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH*.


“Life/Death” has never been played live. This makes it the only song from “The Tale of the Altered Beast” that hasn’t been performed on stage.
Some Context
Consisting of a riff that should be more than familiar to any King Gizzard fan, “Some Context” opens the second story of *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)*: “The Lord of Lightning vs Balrog.” The entire track is the ending riff of [“People-Vultures”](https://kglw.net/song/people-vultures?artist_id=1) with the sound of crows cawing over it — bringing to attention that this story takes place in the same universe as *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)*. While many songs from Murder of the Universe were planned in advance on the band’s [whiteboard](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-released-five-albums-in-a-single-year-198057/), “Some Context” is missing from the lineup. It was released on *Murder of the Universe* on June 23rd, 2017.

“Some Context” is a part of Jason Galea and Ben Jones’ [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd3vwwXArMQ) for “The Lord of Lightning vs Balrog” released on May 30th, 2017. It’s accompanied by footage of the “People-Vultures” [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f78_Tf4Tdk) played on an old TV surrounded by burning candles.  


“Some Context” saw a live debut on [2017-09-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-23-2017-district-square-kalamazoo-mi-usa.html) and was played throughout the end of 2017, usually as a set opener. Since then it has rarely been played — showing up during encores for the band’s fully microtonal shows on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) and [2021-02-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-24-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) with Leah Senior.

The Reticent Raconteur
The first part of “The Lord of Lightning vs Balrog” to feature Leah Senior narration, “The Reticent Raconteur” is a slow, plodding transitional track that introduces the story as witnessed by the narrator. Stu explained the Reticent Raconteur’s story in an [interview for Observer](https://observer.com/2017/04/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-interview/). “…The second story is a sort of battle, it follows a group of people who’ve also been stalked, chased, attacked by a Lord of Lightning, who then subsequently…this is gonna sound so ridiculous… He subsequently captures one member of the party, who turns him into a Balrog. The Balrog is kind of pissed off, and a battle ensues with the Lord of Lightning. The party manages to escape and the Lord of Lightning is sort of victorious.” White the song was not written as its own track on the band’s studio [whiteboard](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-released-five-albums-in-a-single-year-198057/), it was released as part of *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* on June 23rd, 2017.

“The Reticent Raconteur” is included in Jason Galea and Ben Jones’ [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd3vwwXArMQ) for “The Lord of Lightning vs Balrog” released on May 30th, 2017. It intersperses shots of Leah Senior walking through a forest wearing a brown cloak with footage of a creek. At the end of the track, she comes across Stu’s 12-string Hagstrom F12S under a bunch of leaves. Leah’s portrayal of the Raconteur would be referenced on the poster for [2019-07-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-5-2019-unsw-roundhouse-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html).

While a variation of the idea was played during performances of [“The Lord of Lightning,”](https://kglw.net/song/the-lord-of-lightning?artist_id=1) the song made its actual live debut on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) during an encore for the band’s fully microtonal shows at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). Here the song was played alongside narration from Leah Senior, who would do the same thing the [following night](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-24-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html). After a long break it would return on [2022-10-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-2-2022-william-randolph-hearst-greek-theatre-berkeley-ca-usa.html) once again with Leah Senior. Throughout the 2022 US tour the song was played a handful of times in this format, though afterwards it would become an instrumental track with fewer appearances.

The Lord of Lightning
By far one of the most iconic songs from its era, “The Lord of Lightning” is a fast, heavy track focusing on the havoc brought by the titular Lord of Lightning — a godlike figure who attacks a group of (seemingly) innocent people and inadvertently creates The Balrog from the corpse of one of his victims. The song features narration from Leah Senior as well as the band’s hard garage rock sound akin to work from *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)*. During the song’s five-minute runtime, we get multiple references to other pieces of the band’s discography, with repeated uses of the phrase “Nonagon Infinity” and the entire outro consisting of the bassline from the “Mind Fuzz” suite. The song is also reprised during [“The Floating Fire.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-floating-fire?artist_id=1) As of writing, the song sits as their sixth most played live song, beaten only by other classics like [“Gamma Knife”](https://kglw.net/song/gamma-knife?artist_id=1) and [“Rattlesnake.”](https://kglw.net/song/rattlesnake?artist_id=1)

The earliest versions of “The Lord of Lightning” predate *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* by a year. The first known performance of the song was on [2016-07-03](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-july-3-2016-mojos-bar-fremantle-australia.html) with the song making numerous appearances throughout 2016 — even in [promotional material](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1356515037694729) for Gizzfest, as well as [radio shows](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-22-2016-bakehouse-studios-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) promoting *Nonagon Infinity*. The reason for that is that the song [was the result](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxwu7FYFSek&t=1994s) of that album, *Murder of the Universe* as a whole being an attempt to make an uglier, larger version of the Nonagon Infinity sound. These early renditions of the song start with an instrumental section reminiscent of [“The Reticent Raconteur”](https://kglw.net/song/the-reticent-raconteur?artist_id=1) before moving into the song proper. This section would remain a part of the song’s live renditions in the future. The lyrics are notably different from the final version and seem to change from show to show, implying that they were at least partially made on the spot. That said, they are reminiscent of the final version, just with different content for the verse. Just like on the album, these versions of the song end with the bassline of [“I’m In Your Mind”](https://kglw.net/song/im-in-your-mind?artist_id=1) and usually pivot into the suite. It was released as part of Murder of the Universe on June 23rd, 2017. “The Lord of Lightning” was used in [promotional material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hNpTgBMswc) for the album. The single-disc edition of *Murder of the Universe* on vinyl splits “The Lord of Lightning” between sides A and B.

“The Lord of Lightning” features prominently in Jason Galea and Ben Jones’ [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd3vwwXArMQ) for “The Lord of Lightning vs Balrog,” uploaded May 30th, 2017. The song’s segment shows the band playing (occasionally using sticks), in what appears to be the Redwood National and State Parks with fast, flickering cuts between shots and, at times, to band members with the Nonagon Infinity symbol projected onto them.

“The Lord of Lightning” was played frequently in 2017. Early in the year it was played as a standalone after [“People-Vultures”](https://kglw.net/song/people-vultures?artist_id=1) with the intro like in 2016. In March the song was often paired with [“Cellophane”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane?artist_id=1), linking them through the bassline. In September it switched places, now at the beginning of sets during a medley of *Murder of the Universe* material ([“Welcome To An Altered Future”](https://kglw.net/song/welcome-to-an-altered-future?artist_id=1) > [“Digital Black”](https://kglw.net/song/digital-black?artist_id=1) > [“Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg”](https://kglw.net/song/han-tyumi-the-confused-cyborg?artist_id=1) > “The Lord of Lightning” > “Cellophane”). That year the band performed the song on Conan on [2017-04-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-17-2017-warner-bros-studios-burbank-ca-usa.html) — their first (and only as of writing) appearance on U.S. late night television. Going into early 2018 the song kept its 2017 spot, though was pushed back to a second set and [occasionally](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-7-2018-astra-berlin-germany.html) cut from “Cellophane” during the beginning of the year. Later the medley was altered, removing “Welcome to An Altered Future” and replacing “Han-Tyumi…” with [“Vomit Coffin”](https://kglw.net/song/vomit-coffin?artist_id=1). In October its purpose changed again as the medley was removed, leaving “The Lord of Lightning” and “Cellophane” on their own. In 2019 the track was often played on its own though it was sometimes paired with other songs, like on [2019-07-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-july-26-2019-naeba-ski-resort-yuzawa-japan.html). After one appearance in 2020 ([2020-02-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-2-2020-the-domain-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html)), it was played as an encore for the band’s fully microtonal shows at The Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) starting on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) as well as making an appearance for “Garage Rock Night” on [2021-12-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-22-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html). 2022 performances would see the song be performed as part of a medley of “The Lord of Lightning vs Balrog,” with Leah Senior providing narration. Yet while once a given set choice, “The Lord of Lighting” has taken a back seat to many other songs in the Gizz canon with only a couple of performances in 2023/2024. These versions are typically paired with “The Reticent Raconteur.”

The Balrog
At the end of [“The Lord of Lightning”](https://kglw.net/song/the-lord-of-lightning?artist_id=1) it is revealed that during his killing spree, the titular character created a creature out of the corpse of one of his victims. That creature is a Balrog. While the name might bring to mind the [Balrog](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Balrogs) found in J.R.R. Tolkein’s *Lord of the Rings* books, Stu has dismissed the connection saying to [Observer](https://observer.com/2017/04/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-interview/) “this ain’t Middle Earth. It might not be *the* Balrog from Middle Earth, but he is a sort of fire demon.” While the creature was created by the actions of the Lord of Lightning, it instead focuses on the group of onlookers and attacks them. However the Lord interferes and a battle between the two begins. Just like the song before it, “The Balrog” is a fast and heavy onslaught of trippy metal with references to other parts of the band’s discography (notably [“Evil Death Roll”](https://kglw.net/song/evil-death-roll?artist_id=1), [“Trapdoor”](https://kglw.net/song/trapdoor?artist_id=1) and, debatably, [“Cold Cadaver''](https://kglw.net/song/cold-cadaver?artist_id=1)).

The first known performance of “The Balrog” was on [2016-07-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-july-8-2016-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) and the song would see a fair bit of play throughout the rest of the year. Originally the song was disconnected from “The Lord of Lightning”, either played on its own, after the [“Mind Fuzz”](https://kglw.net/song/im-in-your-mind?artist_id=1) suite or with “Trapdoor.” These early versions feature different lyrics than the final version. It would later be released on *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* on June 23rd, 2017 and it appeared in [promotional material](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hNpTgBMswc) for the album.

In Jason Galea and Ben Jones’ [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd3vwwXArMQ) for “The Lord of Lightning vs Balrog”, uploaded May 30th, 2017, “The Balrog” is given its own section. In it, the band plays in a room with videos of fire and lava projected over them and their instruments. The ending cuts to Leah Senior narrating the story in a forest.

After its release, the song was only played for a brief stretch of time in 2017 during a residency at The Night Cat in Naarm (Melbourne), starting on [2017-03-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-18-2017-the-night-cat-melbourne-australia.html) and ending on [2017-03-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-24-2017-the-night-cat-naarm-melbourne-australia.html). Here the song came out of “Cellophane” after a long stretch of [“Gamma Knife”](https://kglw.net/song/gamma-knife?artist_id=1) > [“People-Vultures”](https://kglw.net/song/people-vultures?artist_id=1) > “The Lord of Lightning” > “Cellophane.” In 2018 the song was played more often, starting with a performance on [2018-08-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-13-2018-akvarium-klub-budapest-hungary.html). The song was played throughout the end of the year coming out of parts of the “Mind Fuzz” suite; either [“Cellophane”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane?artist_id=1) or more often than not [“I’m Not In Your Mind.”](https://kglw.net/song/im-not-in-your-mind?artist_id=1) A performance of the song in this form from [2018-08-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-25-2018-domaine-national-de-saint-cloud-saint-cloud-france.html) appears in *[THE NONAGON MOVIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV8knE56GE4&t=1031s)*. This partnership continued into 2019 and even (rarely) included the rest of the suite, like on [2019-10-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-16-2019-x-tra-zrich-switzerland.html) before taking a long break. “The Balrog” returned in 2022 after a performance of the entire Mind Fuzz suite on [2022-05-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-14-2022-cerveceria-hercules-santiago-de-queretaro-mexico.html) and was played two other times in this form. In October the song was put into a medley of “The Lord of Lightning vs Balrog” which saw the song return to its album placement alongside narration from Leah Senior. This only happened two times, and since then it has rarely been played.

The Floating Fire
“The Floating Fire” describes a battle between the Lord of Lightning and the Balrog. While both are powerful beings capable of making the earth shake, it’s clear that the Balrog will lose the fight. The Lord, brandishing a golden stake, flies into space and throws it down at the Balrog, defeating it instantly. Starting with a menacing section with prominent throat singing and ending with a reprise of [“The Lord of Lightning”](https://kglw.net/song/the-lord-of-lightning?artist_id=1), it marks the end of the violence in the tale.

Originally the song did not appear on their planned tracklisting [written on their studio whiteboard](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-released-five-albums-in-a-single-year-198057/). It first appeared in Jason Galea and Ben Jones’ [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd3vwwXArMQ) for “The Lord of Lightning vs Balrog.” It continues the shots seen in [“The Balrog”](https://kglw.net/song/the-balrog?artist_id=1) with the band playing under projections of fire and lava, though it also cuts to Stu singing the song on an old TV with lava running under it. His face is red and black with small, inhuman pupils. After this, Leah Senior is seen on the TV surrounded by the candles previously shown in [“Some Context”](https://kglw.net/song/some-context?artist_id=1) before wrapping back to the band playing beneath new projections of lightning. The song was officially released on June 23rd, 2017 on *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)*.   


“The Floating Fire” has never been played live.
The Acrid Corpse
Following the Lord of Lightning’s final blow, the Balrog’s corpse lays smoldering on the ground. With their foe smited, the Lord exits the battlefield in a clap of thunder, leaving the survivors of the incident in the “moonless night” (later referenced on [“Blue Morpho”](https://kglw.net/song/blue-morpho) and [“Extinction”](https://kglw.net/song/extinction)). This ends the second story of *Murder of the Universe*. Not initially [written on their studio whiteboard](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-released-five-albums-in-a-single-year-198057/) “The Acrid Corpse” is the slowest segment of the suite and consists of synthesizers, Mellotron vocals, Leah Senior’s narration and a steady drum beat.

The song is the finale of Jason Galea and Ben Jones’ [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd3vwwXArMQ) for “The Lord of Lightning vs Balrog.” Its section shows the wizards/monks which originally appeared in the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC7ii3Ir-no) for [“Gamma Knife”](https://kglw.net/song/gamma-knife?artist_id=1) walking around a fire with footage of Leah Senior narrating over them. The final shot of the video is the red wizard/monk played by Joey, looking frightened at the camera, the fire in front of his face. The song was officially released on June 23rd, 2017 on *Murder of the Universe*. The phrase “moonless night” heard in the song also appears in the [alternate lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=artgvkCWxWc) for [“Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg.”](https://kglw.net/song/han-tyumi-the-confused-cyborg?artist_id=1) 


“The Acrid Corpse” has never been played live.
Welcome To An Altered Future
Opening to the sound of Mellotron flutes and vocals as well as whirling synthesizers, we are led to a narration by a text-to-speech voice ([Charles UK](https://www.naturalreaders.com/voicelist.html)) talking about an “altered future.” In this world we are without death and the human need for rest, though it’s increasingly black—[digital black](https://kglw.net/song/digital-black?artist_id=1). “Welcome To An Altered Future” welcomes us to the third and final story of *[Murder of the Universe,](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* (released June 23rd, 2017) entitled “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of The Muder of the Universe.” [Stu explained](https://observer.com/2017/04/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-interview/) the story like this. “…the third chapter is ‘Han-Tyumi and The Murder of the Universe’…I don’t know, I’ve been reading a lot of things lately. Some people say, a *lot* of people say that humanity’s greatest threat may be, at this point in time, A.I.” The song operates as an intro, even being called that during the [album’s production](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-released-five-albums-in-a-single-year-198057/).

Like it does on the album, “Welcome to the Altered Future” opens up Jason Galea’s [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zUPTPlkqDg) for “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe.” Its segment of the video shows red LCD text above a bleak, brown Earth.

The first known performance of the song was on [2017-09-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-23-2017-district-square-kalamazoo-mi-usa.html) during the Audiotree Music Festival in Kalamazoo. The song would be played throughout the rest of 2017 at the start of their shows before spiraling into a medley of *Murder of the Universe* material: “Welcome To An Altered Future” > “Digital Black” > [“Han Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg”](https://kglw.net/song/han-tyumi-the-confused-cyborg?artist_id=1) > [“The Lord of Lightning”](https://kglw.net/song/the-lord-of-lightning?artist_id=1) > [“Cellophane.”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane?artist_id=1) The song continued to be played into 2018 where it would be pushed back to the beginning of their second sets alongside the medley. However it would fall off setlists completely on [2018-03-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-16-2018-fuzz-club-athens-greece.html) and has not been played since, even though the band has played the rest of the suite.
Digital Black
Following the introduction heard in [“Welcome To An Altered Future”](https://kglw.net/song/welcome-to-an-altered-future?artist_id=1), “Digital Black” describes the dystopian future its narrator hinted at. In this future humanity is faced with an existential threat — most likely climate change. Unwilling to die, they transfer their consciousness to computers, creating a society of computerized people who have no connection to humanity. The song’s narrator (Han-Tyumi) is the last human born through natural means and is disillusioned with perpetual, unending life. Any light the world may have had has faded into digital black — as dark as it can get. Outside of the song’s lyrics, which feature many unique words like “lugubrious” and “caliginous,” “Digital Black” is a brutal track with loads of feedbacking, delayed guitars, a steady motorik beat and a quick callback to the story’s opening riff.

A demo for the song appears on *[Demos Vol. 6: Music To Burn Money To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-6-music-to-burn-money-to)*. This version is entirely instrumental with no changes in structure compared to its final version. It also features a jam over the riff of [“Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg.”](https://kglw.net/song/han-tyumi-the-confused-cyborg?artist_id=1) The song was released as a [CD single](https://www.discogs.com/release/10532373-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Digital-Black) and then on *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* on June 23rd, 2017. It would also appear in a [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hNpTgBMswc) for the album.

In the band’s [2022 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i89q8fk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Stu mentioned that this video was one of the most fun to shoot.

The song made its live debut on [2017-09-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-23-2017-district-square-kalamazoo-mi-usa.html) at the Audiotree Music Festival in Kalamazoo as part of a medley of mostly *Murder of the Universe* material. This was mainly: “Welcome To An Altered Future” > “Digital Black” > “Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg” > [“The Lord of Lightning”](https://kglw.net/song/the-lord-of-lightning?artist_id=1) > [“Cellophane.”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane?artist_id=1) Throughout 2017 this was used to open the band’s shows, though in 2018 was pushed back to the second set. 2018 gigs also began to remove “Welcome To An Altered Future” from the sets with “Digital Black” becoming the opener instead. This shortened medley carried on until October where it got shortened to “Digital Black” > [“Vomit Coffin”](https://kglw.net/song/vomit-coffin?artist_id=1) > “The Lord of Lightning.” The song saw heavy rotation in 2018 and even had a performance of the song from 
[2018-08-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-17-2018-glanusk-park-crickhowell-wales.html) appear in *[THE NONAGON MOVIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV8knE56GE4)*. In 2019 the song appeared in a shortened “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe” suite consisting of “Digital Black” > “Vomit Coffin” > [“Murder of the Universe”](https://kglw.net/song/murder-of-the-universe?artist_id=1) though [2019-11-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-november-21-2019-modern-sky-lab-shanghai-china.html) saw a quick “Murder of the Universe”-less performance. The song would be played twice in 2020 with another shortened medley and a performance on [2020-02-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-21-2020-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) adding “Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg” back in. After an unusual solo performance for “Garage Rock Night” on [2021-12-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-22-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html), “Digital Black” was played exclusively as part of the nearly complete suite seen on [2020-02-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-21-2020-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html).

Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg
After a description of the world in the future, we are formally introduced to the narrator of this story, Han-Tyumi. Speaking through the [Charles UK text to speech voice](https://www.naturalreaders.com/voicelist.html), he explains that he was born into a dark world without humanity and that he yearns for two human experiences: to die and to vomit. These two things are actions that a cyborg is incapable of and to Han-Tyumi represent what it means to live. In an [interview for Observer](https://observer.com/2017/04/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-interview/) Stu said “...so you have a character called Han-Tyumi, which is an anagram for ‘humanity.’ Han-Tyumi is kind of like an idiot child or something, a half-human being maintaining very little of his humanity in the distant future. Han-Tyumi, over time, becomes obsessed with humanity, and wanting to regain some of that. I suppose none of that seems awfully unreal or hard to imagine. He becomes obsessed with death and vomiting. Yeah, he’s a confused cyborg, this futuristic guy who wants to regain his humanity, and he decides the two most human things are death and what we would call vomiting, which there’s no digital equivalent of.” While first depicted in the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p_Si21ig7c) for [“Robot Stop”](https://kglw.net/song/robot-stop?artist_id=1) in 2016, “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe” is the first time he was introduced as a proper character. Since then he has appeared on [other songs](https://kglw.net/song/cyboogie) (including live performances of other songs like with [“God Is In The Rhythm”](https://kglw.net/song/god-is-in-the-rhythm)), [album covers](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies), [posters](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-17-2019-harbour-event-convention-centre-vancouver-canada.html), and has even appeared in [soundchecks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj2JHAvm0hY). Han-Tyumi is one of the most beloved characters in the Gizzverse and it all comes back to this introduction. The song itself is inspired by Krautrock with a 15/4 motorik groove and a distinct bass line.

The song was initially conceived as “Jam In E” [according to a whiteboard scribble](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-released-five-albums-in-a-single-year-198057/). A clip of this song is heard at the end of the demo for “Digital Black” released on *[Demos Vol. 6: Music To Burn Money To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-6-music-to-burn-money-to)*. The riff of the song is reused in [“Soy Protein Munt Machine.”](https://kglw.net/song/soy-protein-munt-machine?artist_id=1) It was released on *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* on June 23rd, 2017.

The song is featured in Jason Galea’s [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zUPTPlkqDg) for “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe” released on April 11th, 2017. The section of the video for “Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg” is made up of text transcribing Han-Tyumi’s words. Behind the words is a variety of backgrounds with a variety of effects.

The earliest known performance of “Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg” was on [2017-09-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-23-2017-district-square-kalamazoo-mi-usa.html) at the Audiotree Music Festival in Kalamazoo. Throughout the year the song would be part of a medley of mainly *Murder of the Universe* material: [“Welcome to an Altered Future”](https://kglw.net/song/welcome-to-an-altered-future?artist_id=1) > [“Digital Black”](https://kglw.net/song/digital-black?artist_id=1) > “Han Tyumi, The Confused Cyborg” > [“The Lord of Lightning”](https://kglw.net/song/the-lord-of-lightning?artist_id=1) > [“Cellophane.”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane?artist_id=1) This continued with the band until March of 2018 when the song fell out of setlists. Versions from October 2017 to March 2018 feature an alternate set of lyrics which appeared under the [Facebook upload](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/videos/1752378604775035/) of the music video for [“Crumbling Castle.”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1) These lyrics feature a number of phrases used in other songs such as [“The Acrid Corpse,”](https://kglw.net/song/the-acrid-corpse?artist_id=1) [“Tezeta,”](https://kglw.net/song/tezeta?artist_id=1) [“Hell’s Itch”](https://kglw.net/song/hells-itch?artist_id=1) and numerous songs on *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*. Following 2018, the song was played rarely, with one performance in 2019 on [2019-10-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-15-2019-alcatraz-milan-italy.html) and another during the band’s marathon show on [2020-02-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-21-2020-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). Skipping a year, “Han Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg” returned on [2022-03-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) for the Return of the Curse of Timeland festival as part of a nearly full performance of “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe” minus “Welcome To An Altered Future.” This would be its primary spot in the band’s shows going forward, although it was given an isolated acoustic rendition on [2023-06-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-4-2023-the-caverns-above-ground-amphitheater-pelham-tn-usa.html).

Soy Protein Munt Machine
In an attempt to reconnect with his forgotten humanity, Han-Tyumi decides to create the Soy Protein Munt Machine, a cyborg made with the sole purpose of vomiting and dying. The shortest track in the Han-Tyumi suite takes its title from the machine, though it was initially conceived as “Jam In A” [according to a whiteboard scribble](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-released-five-albums-in-a-single-year-198057/). It’s used to lead into [“Vomit Coffin”](https://kglw.net/song/vomit-coffin?artist_id=1) with the riff from “Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg” in a different key. It was released on *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* on June 23rd, 2017 and briefly appeared in a [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hNpTgBMswc) for the album.

The song appears in Jason Galea’s [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zUPTPlkqDg) for “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe” released on April 11th, 2017. It follows the format of “Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg” with text presented over various backgrounds.


While most of “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe” was played from 2017 to 2019, “Soy Protein Munt Machine” was the last to debut, with a first appearance on [2022-03-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) for The Return of the Curse of Timeland festival in Naarm (Melbourne). The song appeared as part of a (nearly) complete performance of the suite and would solely be played in this configuration. This makes “Soy Protein Munt Machine” the least played track of the Han-Tyumi suite.

Vomit Coffin
“Vomit Coffin” centers on Han-Tyumi’s interactions with his creation, the [Soy Protein Munt Machine](https://kglw.net/song/soy-protein-munt-machine?artist_id=1) (narrated by the [Mel text to speech voice](https://www.naturalreaders.com/voicelist.html)). While Han-Tyumi proclaims that he is both the machine’s father and god, the Munt Machine responds in sadness, arguing that it doesn’t want to live a life of vomit and death. Han-Tyumi, feeling betrayed by his creation, plugs himself in to experience it himself. While the song has a memorably unique name, the song itself is nothing to scoff at. It’s a loud, chugging song with a hypnotic middle section that leads us to the climatic end of *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)*.

A demo for “Vomit Coffin” was released as part of *[Demos Vol. 5: Music To Think Existentially To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-5-music-to-think-existentially-to)*. It’s an instrumental version with a different, longer break section and a shorter ending that doesn’t repeat. Stu revealed during an interview with [Midnight Chats](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3eXD0OvGJKyooFuLlNPbwh?si=8b690fc0b93a47d7) that the song’s title was a reference to another band. “The track title is my little brother Lucky and, um, a few of his friends including my cousin Tom Mackenzie and a bunch of other people… I actually can’t remember the exact lineup but it was just a lot of people that were around our family house when we were young, like, early teenage years, I’d say. They had a band that would rehearse in our — the garage, in the parent’s garage. And, um, it was like a parody metal band and I think they were quietly taking the piss out of me and my friends and the bands that we were playing in… but anyway their band was called Vomit Coffin and I’ll never forget that because it just, it was just so perfect, it was like ‘this is amazing, I’m going to use that in something one day’ and so, yeah, one day it made sense.” “Vomit Coffin” was released on *Murder of the Universe* on June 23rd, 2017 and appeared in a [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hNpTgBMswc) for it.

In Jason Galea’s [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zUPTPlkqDg) for “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe” (released April 30th, 2017) the song is depicted through a live performance of the band, presumably shot at the Night Cat in Naarm/Melbourne with text writing out Han-Tyumi’s dialogue for the break. In the band’s [2022 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i89q8fk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Stu mentioned that this video was one of the most fun to shoot.

The first known performance of the song was on [2017-04-03](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-3-2017-port-city-music-hall-portland-me-usa.html) at Port City Music Hall in Portland where it appeared between [“The Lord of Lightning”](https://kglw.net/song/the-lord-of-lightning?artist_id=1) and [“Am I In Heaven?”](https://kglw.net/song/am-i-in-heaven?artist_id=1) at the end of the set. It remained in this position until May 2018 where it joined [“Digital Black”](https://kglw.net/song/digital-black?artist_id=1) as part of a suite composed almost entirely of *Murder of the Universe* material. This was “Digital Black” > “Vomit Coffin” > “The Lord of Lightning” > [“Cellophane.”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane?artist_id=1) Performances from this time were notably shorter, with an abbreviated version of the song’s middle before a quick rundown of the song’s first verse. This version was played frequently in 2018 before changing in 2019 into part of a shortened version of “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe.” In 2020 the song was played twice, once in the shortened medley, another time in a larger configuration which included [“Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg.”](https://kglw.net/song/han-tyumi-the-confused-cyborg?artist_id=1) This would be the song’s exclusive spot going forward. 2022 versions include the entire song with a narration-less break that is started with a repeated “vomit” line before the first verse, much like at the end of the studio version.

Murder of the Universe
Perhaps the most disgusting song in the King Gizzard canon, “Murder of the Universe” is the climatic conclusion to both “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe” as well as *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* as a whole. After plugging into the [Soy Protein Munt Machine](https://kglw.net/song/soy-protein-munt-machine?artist_id=1), Han-Tyumi is now able to fulfill his dream of vomiting. Unlike how humans spew however, Han-Tyumi’s munt goes through his entire body, builds pressure and bursts in an explosion. His body is blown apart but the vomit keeps coming, flowing out into the public where it engulfs others. His vomit makes its way across the land by traveling through wires before running out of space and building into the sky. While the cavalcade of puke grows to a celestial level, Han-Tyumi feels a sense of euphoria, equating the experience to sex and essentially becoming a god through destruction. Han’s [gray goo scenario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_goo) reaches a point where the concept of time itself is ill, and then under the weight of it all, the universe collapses. Through his urge to vomit, he has brought death not just for himself but for existence itself. The song makes a few references to the band’s discography, such as the concept of microtones and potentially [“Life/Death.”](https://kglw.net/song/life-death?artist_id=1), and is referenced by the songs [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1), and [“Exploding Suns”](https://kglw.net/song/exploding-suns?artist_id=1). The song follows a Krautrock-inspired rhythm in 15/4 that builds and builds with distorted guitars, Mellotron and a heavy breakdown at the song’s conclusion.

While the rest of the Han-Tyumi suite was written out by the band on their [whiteboard](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-released-five-albums-in-a-single-year-198057/), “Murder of the Universe” is distinctly missing from the lineup. It is the only song on the album not credited solely to Stu. Instead, this song’s credits are split between Stu and Joey. At the end of *[A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ4c2v6qTY4&t=421s)* we get to see the band listening to the final version of the song. The band laughs after it ends, with Joey ecstatically yelling “oh my FUCKING god!” It was released on *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* on June 23rd, 2017, with the song’s final seconds making it into a [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hNpTgBMswc) for the album.

Based on available set info, “Murder of the Universe” was first played on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne) after the *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)* track [“Acarine.”](https://kglw.net/song/acarine?artist_id=1) This would be a usual combination for the song throughout 2019, although the song did sometimes join other songs from the Han-Tyumi suite to make a shortened suite of [“Digital Black”](https://kglw.net/song/digital-black?artist_id=1) > [“Vomit Coffin”](https://kglw.net/song/vomit-coffin?artist_id=1) > “Murder of the Universe,” as on [2019-07-03](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-3-2019-the-tivoli-brisbane-qld-australia.html). A performance of the song from [2019-10-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-7-2019-tivolivredenburg-ronda-utrecht-netherlands.html) would be included in the film Chunky Shrapnel, with the documentary taking its name from the song’s lyrics. This version features an overdubbed synthesizer intro which imitates the track’s bass part. That same year a performance on [2019-08-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-23-2019-riverside-theater-milwaukee-wi-usa.html) featured a technical error where Han-Tyumi’s narration didn’t play. This led to an abbreviated version of the song. While somewhat noteworthy on its own, this show was released as the bootlegger *[Live In Milwaukee ‘19](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-milwaukee-19)*, making it the only official version of the song without lyrics. This recording also features a unique line from Han-Tyumi, “Hello. My name is Han-Tyumi and I fucked up the concert.” The song would be played twice in 2020. On [2020-02-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-february-7-2020-harts-mill-adelaide-australia.html) it was in the shortened suite while another performance on [2020-02-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-21-2020-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) saw the addition of “Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg.” After a break in 2021, it returned on [2022-05-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-15-2022-guanamor-teatro-estudio-zapopan-jal-mexico.html) in a longer suite with “Soy Protein Munt Machine.” Ever since then, this has been the song’s typical placement.

Sketches of Brunswick East
Sketches of Brunswick East I
A short instrumental with an instantly memorable melody, “Sketches of Brunswick East I” is an upbeat opening track and the first of three distinct variations on the same theme heard on *[Sketches of Brunswick East](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)*. 


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HITmuGw612s?si=rC7q7qtDCVTSrN82&amp;start=492" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


A demo for the main melody was first heard in an impromptu [demo live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ge8A4pC6mE&t=295s) hosted by the band, and was eventually released as part of *[Demos Vol. 1: Music To Kill Bad People To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-1)*. The demo version consists of a jam on the main theme and was later split into three songs. The tone is most like “Sketches of Brunswick East I”. On April 3rd, 2017, a user named Blinky Bill posted a link to [a playlist of demos on Soundcloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/63az0v/hype_train_new_album_polygondwanaland/) called “Polygondwanaland” in the Facebook King Gizzard fan group. Alongside demos for [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1)  and the [“Polygondwanaland”](https://kglw.net/song/polygondwanaland?artist_id=1) suite, were two tracks called “Spanish,” each one given a different number. “Spanish I (1)” was the fourth song in the playlist. While the *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)* demos were ripped by fans, this track wasn’t, leaving it a mystery as to what exactly it was. That said, we can infer that it was “Sketches of Brunswick East I” due to the connection with the album title inspiration, *[Sketches of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketches_of_Spain)* by Miles Davis. ‘Blinky Bill’’’ was later revealed to be Stu, who requested that all of the demos not be leaked as they were accidentally shared to the public group. The studio version was played by Alex Brettin (piano), Cavs (drum kit 1/snare brushes/maracas/floor tom/vibraslap/bongos), Cook (guitar) and Stu (bass/electric piano/flute) and released on August 18th, 2017.


King Gizzard has never played the song live based on available data though setlist.fm indicates the song may have been played a number of times by Mild High Club.
Countdown
With wah wah guitars, shiny keys, and a strong rhythm section switching through time signatures, “Countdown” speaks of someone anxiously waiting for the end of the world, fearing that they might mess it all up and be late. While this anticipated apocalypse is never explicitly referred to, and is up to interpretation, the idea of counting down paired with the language of destroyed buildings, torn shirts, and [D-Day](https://kglw.net/song/d-day?artist_id=1) seems to imply war and weapons of mass destruction as at least a factor in the downfall of humanity. The studio version was played by Alex Brettin (bass/electric piano/synthesizer), Cavs (drum kit 1/drum kit 2/bongos), Lucas (Mellotron/electric piano) and Stu (“wah wah guitar”/vocals/Mellotron) and released from *[Sketches of Brunswick East](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)* (on August 18th, 2017) and has the unique distinction of being the only *Sketches* song mixed by Alex Brettin. The album cover references the song with the rubble of buildings being a prominent part of the art.

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPl4WLM55Vg) for “Countdown” was released on September 20th, 2017. The video features hand drawn 2D animation by Jason Galea featuring a psychedelic Rube Goldberg machine which leads to a car crashing into 253 Lygon Street, better known at the time as Flightless HQ. A [limited edition book containing every drawing from the video](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bem6Ps5Ajy4/?taken-by=jj_cool_juice&img_index=7) was made by Jason Galea and sold in January of 2018, according to [Galea’s Big Cartel store page](https://web.archive.org/web/20180330020505/http://jasongalea.bigcartel.com:80/product/countdown-animation-sequence-book). The drawings were done over sixty-four days, starting on July 17th and ending on September 19th. The video version features a different mix, with a noticeably different ending where the song slows down with a distorted crash.

The earliest known performance of the song was on [2017-09-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-24-2017-lincoln-hall-chicago-il-usa.html) at Lincoln Hall in Chicago. The song appeared at the end of the set next to “Rolling Stoned” and was played with members of Mild High Club who were opening for the band at the time. The [following night](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-september-25-2017-lincoln-hall-chicago-il-usa.html), the song appeared in the same spot, also featuring Mild High Club. The song’s final appearance was on the [next night](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-september-26-2017-cannery-ballroom-nashville-tn-usa.html) at the Cannery Ballroom in Nashville. No other performances of the song are known to exist, making it a very rare song in the band’s repertoire.
D-Day
Centered on a countdown from eleven (spaced out to a fourteen count due to the syllables), “D-Day” follows on from the apocalyptic theme of [“Countdown,”](https://kglw.net/song/countdown?artist_id=1) featuring an anxious rhythm and the sound of exploding bombs. It’s one of two microtonal songs on *[Sketches of Brunswick East](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)* and is the only instrumental of the two.


The song was played by Alex Brettin (microtonal synthesizer/Optigan), Cavs (drum kit 1/drum kit 2/floor toms/bongo/tambourine), Joey (microtonal bass guitar/shaker) and Stu (microtonal guitar/vocals/Mellotron). When asked if a synth hit heard in the song was lifted from the video game [Super Smash Bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros.) during the band’s [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6ou2v/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Lucas responded he didn’t think so and that Nintendo “would probably sue us” if that was the case.The song was released on August 18th, 2017. “D-Day” is referenced in the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPl4WLM55Vg) for “Countdown,” which contains countdowns starting at eleven.

The first known performance of the song was on [2018-02-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-18-2018-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) as part of a completely microtonal set at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). The song was part of a suite of [“Anoxia”](https://kglw.net/song/anoxia) > “D-Day” > [“Sleep Drifter”](https://kglw.net/song/sleep-drifter) > [“The Book.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-book?artist_id=1) Throughout February this would be the song’s average spot until March, where it would appear in various different spots. The last known performance from 2018 would be on [2018-03-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-16-2018-fuzz-club-athens-greece.html), leading to a three year rest. It came back into the rotation on [2021-04-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-21-2021-unibar-university-of-wollongong-wollongong-australia.html) as the band began doing entirely microtonal shows following the release of *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)* and *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)*. It would appear three times that year before once again falling off setlists with a one-off performance on [2022-05-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-22-2022-mr-smalls-theatre-millvale-pa-usa.html) at the Mr. Smalls Theatre in Millvale. Live versions of the song do not contain much counting compared to the studio version and don’t deviate from the studio version’s structure.

Tezeta
Tizita is a scale and genre found in Ethiopian music. The word itself means memory, nostalgia, or longing, themes that are [strongly reflected in the music](https://www.ethiopiaintheory.org/new-page-2). Artists such as [Mahmoud Ahmed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmed), [Hailu Mergia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hailu_Mergia) and [Mulatu Astatke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulatu_Astatke) would reflect on the past in their work to emotional results. It was a pathway to memories drifting away in hopes that you can truly go back and live those moments again (described beautifully by Makda Teshome [here](https://tillism.com/2022/04/25/tizita-ethiopia/)). King Gizzard was no doubt influenced by Ethiopian music. In a [press release](https://heavenlyrecordings.com/new-release-king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-with-mild-high-club-present-sketches-of-brunswick-east/) for [Sketches of Brunswick East](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east), Stu said of the album’s inspiration “we were listening to compilations of Ethiopian music form the 1960s and 70s a lot.” Their song “Tezeta” is also about remembering what once was, though in a much more surreal sense. Dealing with spirituality, “Tezeta” follows someone who feels changed after a realization that the universe isn’t real but in fact a hologram. The song features an appearance from Han-Tyumi, the cyborg first heard on [Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe). Here, he talks to characters in the song and sings a handful of lyrics which paint him as a God. Specifically, Han-Tyumi claims “I am that which I am,” a quote taken from the Hebrew Bible (Exodus 3:14) spoken by God when responding to Moses’ question about God’s name. This phrase also appears in the alternate lyrics for [“Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg.”](https://kglw.net/song/han-tyumi-the-confused-cyborg) As for memory, Han-Tyumi asks the followers if they remember his “altered plan,” yet another callback to *Murder of the Universe*. Ultimately “Tezeta” serves as a loving homage to Ethiopian music while containing much of Gizzard’s musical and conceptual identity. The result is a fan favorite from *Sketches of Brunswick East*.

A demo for the song (released on *[Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2)*) is entirely instrumental with a drum machine playing a bossa nova beat and wah wah-heavy guitar playing the chords over it. The first chorus goes on longer than the final version. The verse is the same as it appears on *Sketches of Brunswick East*. The studio version was played by Alex Brettin (organ), Cavs (drum kit 1/cowbell/bongo), Cook (electric guitar), Eric (drum kit 2), Joey (glass marimbas/shaker/acoustic guitar/synthesizers/vocals/electric guitar), Lucas (electric piano) and Stu (bass/flute/acoustic guitar). The song was released on August 18th, 2017.

The first known performance of the song was on [2018-11-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-24-2018-the-governor-hindmarsh-hotel-adelaide-sa-australia.html) at The Governor Hindmarsh Hotel in Adelaide. The song would see at least two other appearances in 2018 with the last of the year being on [2018-12-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-1-2018-royal-melbourne-showgrounds-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) as part of Gizzfest. 2018 versions did not feature the chorus lyrics or the Han-Tyumi bridge lyrics, opting for instrumentals passages instead. On [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) the song was brought back to setlists to be played a handful of times in 2019. This time the missing lyrics had been added back outside of the “I am true perspective” lines. While Joey would yell out Han’s lines, Stu would take the place of Han-Tyumi’s followers, either repeating the lines ([2019-09-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-2-2019-tabernacle-atlanta-ga-usa.html), or putting his own in, such as “what’s that Joey?” ([2019-10-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-7-2019-tivolivredenburg-ronda-utrecht-netherlands.html)). Since a performance at the TivoliVredenburg Ronda in Utrecht, “Tezeta” has only appeared a few times. These performances feature the “I am true perspective lines” but don’t feature Stu doing the quotes.

Cranes, Planes, Migraines
A short instrumental incorporating the sounds of trains and machinery, “Cranes, Planes, Migraines” represents urban society, its constantly changing landscape, and how industrialization and technological advancement can create a chaotic, nauseating world. Stu had some [relevant insight when talking about Sketches](https://pitchfork.com/news/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-surprise-release-new-album-listen/): “We’re always walking up and down the street all the time, going to get coffee, lugging amps, just constantly wandering Lygon Street... seeing the terrain change as new apartment buildings are erected, watching the cranes build bigger cranes. In that respect, perhaps it represents greater changes that are happening in the wider world, and this is our attempt to find beauty within a place that we spend so much time.” The song is contrasted by the next on *[Sketches of Brunswick East](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)*, [“The Spider and Me,”](https://kglw.net/song/the-spider-and-me?artist_id=1) which proclaims a love for nature. “Cranes, Planes, Migraines” was played by Alex Brettin (synthesizer/microtonal synthesizer), Cavs (drum kit 1/drum kit 2/cowbell/bongo), Cook (electric guitar), Joey (bass/synthesizers) and Stu (glass marimbas/Mellotron). It was released on August 18th, 2017 and is referenced on the album cover for *Sketches* by a crane holding a wrecking ball in the middle of the scene.


The song has never been played live based on available data, but was reportedly soundchecked on [2022-05-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-22-2022-mr-smalls-theatre-millvale-pa-usa.html). 
The Spider and Me
“The Spider and Me” is a blissful song about the wonders of nature, viewing humanity’s relationship to the animals of Earth through a loving relationship between someone and a spider. The lyrics state that there’s no difference between humans and arachnids as we’re both “from the same cloth” — mortal creatures on Earth. The song plays around with the idea of love between human and spider with its bridge containing a strange, passionate back-and-forth. “The Spider and Me” specifically mentions the [Huntsman Spider](https://australian.museum/learn/animals/spiders/huntsman-spiders/) (Sparassidae), a species of spider found mostly in Oceania, known for their size and for their proclivity to co-inhabit human houses.

A demo for the song was first heard on the band’s [unannounced demo stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ge8A4pC6mE&t=293s) and released on *[Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2)*. It is a simple instrumental version that is close to the structure of the final version, though with a marimba solo section instead of the long passage of Joey talking to the spider. The studio version was performed by Alex Brettin (electric piano), Ambrose (vocals), Cavs (drum kit 1/drum kit 2), Joey (bass), Lucas (electric piano/Mellotron) and Stu (“wah wah guitar”/vocals/Mellotron). The song was released on August 18th, 2017 as the sixth song on *[Sketches of Brunswick East](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)*. The album cover references it with a spider in a window hanging from a web. According to a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6rcx7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu recorded the Mellotron solo on the song, saying “it took so many takes to get that!” 


“The Spider and Me” has never been played live based on available data.
Sketches of Brunswick East II
The longest of the three parts, “Sketches of Brunswick East II” is a slow jam on the album’s main theme, introducing parts not heard in the first, and giving the song room to breathe. The track starts with the sound of the [Optigan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5mBg9sXRi8), a keyboard that plays sound off of a disc. The specific disc used is called “Big Band Beat.” A [digital version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTap1jgopBo) was released in early 2017.

A demo for the main melody was first heard in an impromptu [demo live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ge8A4pC6mE&t=295s) hosted by the band, and was eventually released as part of *[Demos Vol. 1: Music To Kill Bad People To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-1)*. The demo version consists of a jam on the main theme and was later split into three songs. The studio version of “Sketches of Brunswick East II” was played by Alex Brettin (electric piano/Optigan/synthesizer/electronic drum kit), Cavs (drum kit 1/drum kit 2/maracas/floor toms/bongos) and Stu (bass/flute/electric piano). It was released on August 18th, 2017.

While never being played by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, “Sketches of Brunswick East II” has been played by Mild High Club. The earliest confirmed performance was on [December 21st, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osbY3Bg0H2g) at the Observatory in Santa Ana, where the band pulled out a four minute rendition of the song. Mild High Club would open for King Gizzard in Spring of 2018 and with that, they continued to play the song. On [2018-03-03](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-3-2018-laeronef-lille-france.html) at the L'Aéronef in Lille, [Stu played the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK3KbcZTV7s) alongside Mild High Club. [Three days later](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-6-2018-paradiso-grote-zaal-amsterdam-netherlands.html) at the Paradiso Grote, Mild High Club would perform the song again, this time without Stu. These are the only known performances of the song.
Dusk To Dawn On Lygon Street
The only Cook Craig-led track on *[Sketches of Brunswick East](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)*, “Dusk To Dawn On Lygon Street” examines the passage of time, describing it by looking at one street in particular. Lygon Street was where King Gizzard’s first label Flightless Records was headquartered. The space was at 253 Lygon St, Brunswick East, Victoria and was where almost all the band’s visual and musical output at the time was created, including *Sketches of Brunswick East*. The street and the label’s HQ would be represented on the album cover for *Sketches*. “Dusk To Dawn On Lygon Street” was performed by Alex Brettin (electric piano/bass/electric guitar), Cavs (drum kit 1/snare brushes/bongos/vibraslap), Cook (electric guitar/vocals/synthesizer/fretless bass) and Stu (bass guitar/Mellotron. It was released on August 18th, 2017.


“Dusk To Dawn On Lygon Street” has never been played live based on available data.
The Book
“The Book” follows a religious fanatic who believes that God has told them that they’ll soon enact the rapture and leave all of the sinners to die. They warn of the oncoming apocalypse by threatening suicide and/or murder as a sacrifice for the Lord, as instructed to by ‘the book’, which can be inferred to be the Bible or some other religious text. It is one of two microtonal songs on *[Sketches of Brunswick East](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)*, and the only of these tracks with lyrics. The song was performed by Alex Brettin (synthesizer), Cavs (drum kit 1/drum kit 2/tambourine/bongos/floor toms/cowbell), Cook (electric guitar), Joey (bass), Lucas (electric piano) and Stu (microtonal organ/vocals/Mellotron). It was released on August 18th, 2017.

The earliest performance to our knowledge was on [2018-02-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-18-2018-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). It appeared at the end of a medley of songs throughout February ([“Anoxia”](https://kglw.net/song/anoxia) > [“D-Day”](https://kglw.net/song/d-day?artist_id=1) > [“Sleep Drifter”](https://kglw.net/song/sleep-drifter) > “The Book”) before switching placement in March. These versions were often condensed (ranging from two to three minutes) and were completely instrumental, serving as a place to jam rather than play close to the recorded version. After a performance on [2018-03-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-7-2018-astra-berlin-germany.html), the song took a three year break, returning on [2021-04-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-21-2021-unibar-university-of-wollongong-wollongong-australia.html) at the UniBar for the band’s completely microtonal shows that year. “The Book” was played a few times in 2022, but had fallen out of rotation. These later versions feature the lyrics unlike the 2018 version and are longer than the studio version, often containing a drum solo from Cavs.

A Journey To (S)hell
A completely instrumental track, “A Journey To (S)hell” is a chaotic song with the sounds of beeping cars, strange laughing, distorted guitars, wailing synthesizers, and a 7/8 groove. The song title is a pun referring to Shell gas stations, and to one on Lygon St. in particular (179-189 Lygon St.), not far from Flightless HQ. A [Facebook live stream](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/videos/1693648383981391) from the day of the *[Sketches](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)*’s release shows the band walking to the store to grab a few things before listening to the album in its entirety. It's likely the song is also inspired by [the wider ecological issues](https://news.mongabay.com/2016/05/shell-spills-90000-gallons-crude-oil-gulf-mexico/) that Shell has presented over the years, with its doomy atmosphere and later songwriting comparisons between hell and burning fossil fuels. The song was played by Alex Brettin (electric guitar), Ambrose (harmonica), Cavs (drum kit 1/drum kit 2), Joey (bass) and Stu (synthesizer). It was released on August 18th, 2017.

Rolling Stoned
“Rolling Stoned” is a calm instrumental track that originated as a Mild High Club song before making it onto *[Sketches of Brunswick East](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)*. Alex Brettin received sole writing credit on the song, making it the first recorded cover by King Gizzard since their obscure [“Lean Woman Blues”](https://kglw.net/song/lean-woman-blues) recording from 2013.

The song originally appeared as a demo on Mild High Club’s [self-titled cassette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnK8uvyX5ks). This version features a stilted drum beat but runs the same length. On the 2015 album *[Timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_(Mild_High_Club_album)*), a cut down version of the song appears at the end of “The Chat.” Before King Gizzard ever recorded the song, we know that Stu had played the song with the band. During a Mild High Club gig at the Subterranean in Chicago on September 6th, 2015, [Stu joined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNSrAcfYQb4) to play flute and guitar on the song. He played it with Mild High Club again on March 3rd, 2016 in Paris, this time alongside Cavs. A clip of this performance appears in *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=458s)*, where it is listed as “The Chat.” For *Sketches of Brunswick East*, the song was performed by Ambrose (harmonica), Andrew Burt (guitar), Cavs (drum kit 1/drum kit 2/maracas/bongo), Cook (bass), Joey (Omnichord/piano), Lucas (piano) and Stu (“wah wah guitar”/flute/synthesizers/piano). It’s the only song on *Sketches of Brunswick East* to feature Andrew Bert of Mild High Club and is also the only track to not have any recording contributions by Alex Brettin. King Gizzard’s version of the song would be released on August 18th, 2017. On January 19th, 2018, [a 7” single of “Rolling Stoned”](https://www.discogs.com/release/11433716-Mild-High-Club-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Rolling-Stoned) was released on Stones Throw Records. It contains both King Gizzard’s version as well as Mild High Club’s, though at a faster speed than the version on their self-titled cassette and *Timeline*.

The first known performance of the song was on [2017-09-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-24-2017-lincoln-hall-chicago-il-usa.html) at Lincoln Hall in Chicago. The song followed the [“Countdown”](https://kglw.net/song/countdown?artist_id=1) at the end of the show and was played with members of Mild High Club, who were opening at the time. The [following night](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-september-25-2017-lincoln-hall-chicago-il-usa.html), the song appeared in the same spot also featuring Mild High Club. The song’s final appearance was on the [next night](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-september-26-2017-cannery-ballroom-nashville-tn-usa.html) at the Cannery Ballroom in Nashville. No other performances of the song are known to exist.

You Can Be Your Silhouette
[Stu described](https://pitchfork.com/news/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-surprise-release-new-album-listen/) *[Sketches of Brunswick East](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)* as “our attempt to find beauty within a place that we spend so much time” and perhaps no other song embodies this concept of finding peace as “You Can Be Your Silhouette.” A bossa nova song with twisting guitars, the lyrics speak of coming to grips with one’s self, and finding strength and comfort within the here and now. Life may be rough at times, you may be anxious over the future, but you’re capable of making your way through it. The song is meditative, relaxing, and introspective.

A demo of the song was released on *[Demos Vol. 6: Music To Burn Money To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-6-music-to-burn-money-to)*. The song seems to be recorded in a room with Stu singing a draft of early lyrics that are hard to make out over the band, though Stu seems to keep singing “you can be my only mind” instead of the title. The song appears structurally close to the final version but features a different outro. On *Sketches of Brunswick East*, the song was performed by Alex Brettin, (bass/organ), Ambrose (harmonica), Cavs (drum kit 1/drum kit 2), Joey (bongos/guiro) and Stu (“wah wah guitar”/vocals/acoustic guitar). The song would be released on August 18th, 2017.


“You Can Be Your Silhouette” has never been played live based on available data.
Sketches of Brunswick East III
The sound of rewinding tape leads into the slowest jam of the album, “Sketches of Brunswick East III”, wrapping up *[Sketches](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)* with one final jazzy instrumental which expands on the album’s theme.

A demo for the main melody was first heard in an impromptu [demo live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ge8A4pC6mE&t=295s) hosted by the band, and was eventually released as part of *[Demos Vol. 1: Music To Kill Bad People To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-1)*. The demo version consists of a jam on the main theme and was later split into three songs. On April 3rd, 2017, a Facebook user named Blinky Bill posted a link to [a playlist of demos on Soundcloud](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/63az0v/hype_train_new_album_polygondwanaland/) called “Polygondwanaland” in the Facebook King Gizzard fan group. Alongside demos for [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1) and the 
[“Polygondwanaland”](https://kglw.net/song/polygondwanaland?artist_id=1) suite were two tracks called “Spanish,” each one given a different number. “Spanish III (3)” was the fifth song in the playlist. While the *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)* demos were ripped by fans, the others were not, making it unclear what they were exactly. That said, “Spanish III (3)” can be inferred to be “Sketches of Brunswick East III” due to the connection with the album title inspiration, *[Sketches of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketches_of_Spain)* by Miles Davis. ‘Blinky Bill’’’ was later revealed to be Stu, who requested that the demos not be leaked as they were accidentally shared to the public group. The studio version was performed by Alex Brettin (electric guitar), Cavs (drum kit 1/drum kit 2/bongos/maracas/floor toms), Cook (fretless bass) and Stu (electric guitar/bass/Mellotron/flute) and was released on August 18th, 2017.


According to current setlist data, King Gizzard has never played the song live. Setlist.fm indicates that Mild High Club may have played the song during their own shows.
Polygondwanaland
Notes:
How to describe single events that affect multiple songs, such as the demo leaks that ended up being four songs on the final album. One generic description copied between each song history, or the current varied drafts? Copied should work just fine.
Crumbling Castle
The opening track of 2017’s boundary-pushing and royalty free *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)* is its longest — a ten minute behemoth called “Crumbling Castle.” In a castle somewhere, its inhabitants are threatened by rising green tides that inch their way up the land as storms blare overhead. However the song’s protagonist, glassy-eyed and divine, mentions that they may have hints as to what the future holds. The answers lie within Polygondwanaland. The song is a perfect opener, setting up the album’s progressive rock influence with its fluctuating time signatures, nearly eleven minute length and fantasy setting. Looking back it seemed destined to be an essential Gizzard track, it checks all the boxes. Strange but evocative lyrics, complex compositions, jams that will open the mosh pit… “Crumbling Castle” really has it all. The band has played the song pretty consistently since its release and it’s hard to blame them for it. Yet all classics have to come from somewhere. “Crumbling Castle” didn’t just come to them in a dream one night. So what’s the deal? Well, the history of the song is actually a bit strange. It involves shortened versions, a leak, potentially getting cut off an album and some live show changes.

The earliest known performance of “Crumbling Castle” was on [2016-8-29](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-29-2016-moth-club-london-england.html) at the MOTH Club in London. While the show was heavy on Nonagon Infinity material with the whole album being played, they did play other songs and one of them was a then unreleased and shortened version of the sprawling epic. This version features different lyrics than the final version, a trait which continues in the following performances. Days later on [2016-08-31](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-31-2016-doornroosje-nijmegen-netherlands.html) a new chorus lyric is heard being tried. On [2016-09-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-1-2016-paradiso-grote-zaal-amsterdam-netherlands.html) we can hear a few unique phrases. Instead of “water’s rising up, thick and green” we have “ocean’s rising up, thick and green.” Moving into the first chorus, Stu sings “look upon our history, crumbling castle, you cannot seem to believe, crumbling castle.” The second features the line “look upon our condition, crumbling castle, this is surely what we’ve become, crumbling castle.” Another interesting detail is that at this point the second verse did not exist and was instead the first verse repeated again. Around these unused lyrics are different intros and outros somewhat reminiscent of the studio ending. As the days go on lyrics are replaced at each show but the only lines in contention seemed to be during the choruses. [2016-09-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-6-2016-concorde-2-brighton-england.html) features the line “look upon our history, crumbling castle, you would not believe what you see, crumbling castle.” A few months later on [2016-9-8](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-september-8-2016-electric-brixton-london-england.html) there was “look upon our history, crumbling castle, you could not believe where I’ve been, crumbling castle” and “look upon our extinction, crumbling castle, you would not believe where I’m from, crumbling castle.” It seems that for some reason that part of the song was hard to get right. The song disappeared from sets in late 2016 though the band was still working on it. 


In the behind-the-scenes video for *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* titled *[A BRIEF HISTORY OF PLANET EARTH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ4c2v6qTY4)* you can spot writing on the wall detailing “Crumbling Castle.” At that point in the song’s history it was split into two parts with a third part being labeled “Crumbling Castle Part 2 Keep.” The song sits directly under [“The Lord of Lightning”](https://kglw.net/song/the-lord-of-lightning?artist_id=1) and [“The Balrog”](https://kglw.net/song/the-balrog?artist_id=1) — showing that the song was initially meant for *Murder of the Universe*. Later in the video [the song is written out again](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-released-five-albums-in-a-single-year-198057/), this time as an intro and three different parts. Here it is sandwiched between “The Tale of the Altered Beast” and “The Lord of Lightning vs Balrog.” All of this said, “Crumbling Castle” never made it to the album due to it not fitting the record. In an [interview with Guitar World](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/the-10-best-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-songs-so-far) in 2020, Stu said “This was the hardest song that we’d ever made. It came about when we were making *Murder Of The Universe*, and it started off as this more metal-ish, heavy track, but it just felt like it had this rhythmic depth to it. We were doing this polyrhythm thing where the bass and drums are in one groove and the guitars and vocals are sitting in another pocket, and it just kept pulling away from that record and saying ‘I don’t belong here, I’ve got this other vibe going on’. So that song was left off that record, and it kept developing, morphing. I think we recorded four or five different versions of it before it felt done. It was a super challenging song, and we were still learning how to mess around with these types of music.”


On April 3rd of 2017, [a Facebook account named Blinky Bill had linked to five demos](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/63az0v/hype_train_new_album_polygondwanaland/) on a playlist titled “Polygondwanaland” in a King Gizzard fan group. In this batch of demos was “Crumbling Castle (Parts I,II+III)” — a purely instrumental version of the song spanning nine minutes and twenty five seconds. Compared to other demos (even from *Polygondwanaland* such as [“Horology”](https://kglw.net/song/horology?artist_id=1)) this early version is close to the final version though there are a few key differences. The hammer-on riff at 2:28 (2:11 on *Polygondwanaland*) goes for four bars rather than three and doesn’t end with the usual break. The “freak out” part at the end of the song is there but played calmly. The song ends differently than its studio counterpart as well, with the band bringing back the four chords heard before “I don’t want to fall into dust.” Outside of the structural changes the tempo is slower, making for a much more relaxing version of the song. As of writing this the “Crumbling Castle” demo has not made it onto any of the band’s demo compilations but can be found online. The studio version of the track would be recorded at Tender Trap Studios in Northcote by Ryan K. Brennan alongside [“The Fourth Colour.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-fourth-colour?artist_id=1) *Polygondwanaland* was released on November 17th, 2017 as a free download for fans to publish, remix and use for their own projects. “Crumbling Castle” served as both its opener and its longest track clocking in at ten minutes and forty four seconds. The song’s seventh verse would be referenced on the album’s cover.

[A music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLP8rFrL1W0) for the song by Jason Galea was released on October 18th, 2017. Unlike other videos from that year, it was [composed entirely of analog VFX and animation](https://jasongalea.com/crumbling-castle). When uploaded to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/videos/1752378604775035/), the band added a cryptic passage. This ended up being alternate lyrics to the Murder of the Universe track [“Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg.”](https://kglw.net/song/han-tyumi-the-confused-cyborg?artist_id=1) “Crumbling Castle” was the only video released for *Polygondwanaland* and was the last music video of 2017.

A day after the release of *Polygondwanaland*, the song would reappear at a [live show at The Marquee in Brisbane](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-18-2017-the-marquee-rna-showgrounds-brisbane-qld-australia.html). In November, the song’s “doom” outro was played following [“Doom City”](https://kglw.net/song/doom-city?artist_id=1) and since then it has not been played live. 2018 was a good year for the song as it was played at a majority of the shows. It was also that year when the band began to use the song as the start of a medley of songs mainly from *Polygondwanaland*. Early in the year the song was part of a two song combo with “The Fourth Colour” which bypassed the outro entirely. Starting around [2018-05-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-may-24-2018-theatre-royal-castlemaine-australia.html) it would become part of a long medley of “Crumbling Castle” > “The Fourth Colour” > [“Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet”](https://kglw.net/song/deserted-dunes-welcome-weary-feet?artist_id=1) > [“The Castle In the Air”](https://kglw.net/song/the-castle-in-the-air?artist_id=1) > [“Muddy Water.”](https://kglw.net/song/muddy-water?artist_id=1) This incarnation was played throughout the second half of 2018. The song’s outro was thrown out completely by this point but would make some appearances at the end of “Doom City.” “Crumbling Castle” from [2018-08-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-18-2018-festivalpark-kiewit-hasselt-belgium.html) at the Afisha Picnic Festival in Moscow appeared in the videos *[ПАДАЮЩИЙ СНЕГ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4Nqfbuqke8)* and *[THE NONAGON MOVIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV8knE56GE4)*.
The song began to appear less in 2019 as the band’s setlists were given more variety but the song continued to stand. The two variations on the medley were played throughout the year but it also saw appearances as a standalone track (with intro) such as [2019-10-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-5-2019-alexandra-palace-london-england.html) (later released as *[Live in London ‘19](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-london-19)*). The song would also appear at the beginning of the band’s short film *[RATTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AzPaId5Qc)*. The song was played twice in 2020 before the pandemic and wouldn’t return until [2022-04-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-27-2022-phoenix-theatre-petaluma-ca-usa.html) as the show’s closer. The song, now being exclusively played with intro, was a standalone track until the marathon show at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, CA on [2022-10-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-2-2022-william-randolph-hearst-greek-theatre-berkeley-ca-usa.html) where it was paired with “The Fourth Colour” once again. The song has mostly been played as part of this duo since then though an unusual “Crumbling Castle” > [“Witchcraft”](https://kglw.net/song/witchcraft) from [2024-03-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-23-2024-autodromo-de-interlagos-sao-paulo-brazil.html) shows that even this sacred rule can be broken. “Crumbling Castle” appeared as one of a few King Gizzard songs played at [Cavs’ first drum seminar on September 21st, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9O9b-U0nl4). In 2019 when asked what the hardest song to pull off live was, [Lucas said](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3egpj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that “Crumbling Castle took ages to master.” A year later, Cavs [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnr5w0i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that it's one of his favorites to play.

Polygondwanaland
The [album’s](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland) title track is a short introduction for the three song “Polygondwanaland” suite, also including [“The Castle in the Air”](https://kglw.net/song/the-castle-in-the-air?artist_id=1) and [“Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet”](https://kglw.net/song/deserted-dunes-welcome-weary-feet?artist_id=1). It is a midtempo, relaxed description of a quest to the mythical land in question. Saying goodbye to their family, our protagonist leaves with a group of travelers to see what it may hold.
The song’s title (and by extension the album’s) is a portmanteau combining the word “poly” with “Gondwanaland.” The prefix ‘poly’ means ‘many’ and in this instance refers to the polymeters and polyrhythms (each musical voice has varying amounts of beats per measure) that make up the album’s composition. Gondwana was a supercontinent formed six hundred million years ago that has since split into Africa, the Americas, India, Australia, and Antarctica through tectonic plate shift. Polygondwanaland, on the other hand, is a dream-like place that the travelers of the narrative wish to go. The song is one of the simpler tunes on the album, remaining in 9/8 throughout its duration, easing us into the time signature experimentation after the barrage on the track before. “Polygondwanaland” has only seen a few performances throughout the years. 


The song’s first appearance was by accident. On April 3rd, 2017, [a number of Soundcloud demos from the band leaked](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/63az0v/hype_train_new_album_polygondwanaland/)  as part of a playlist titled “Polygondwanaland” by a Facebook user named Blinky Bill. Included in the demos was “Polygondwanaland I+II+III”with a runtime of nine minutes and ten seconds. While the length might be of shock to anyone familiar, the demo contained not just “Polygondwanaland” but “The Castle In the Air” and “Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet” as well. While the demo is completely instrumental, there’s nothing about the track that is notably different outside of a lack of synth. The studio version of the track was recorded by Casey Harnett at Flightless HQ and released on November 17th, 2017.

“Polygondwanaland” was (to our knowledge) first played live a few months later on [2018-2-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-18-2018-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) without acoustic guitar. It would only be played a few times after, last appearing on [2018-03-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-7-2018-astra-berlin-germany.html) at Astra in Berlin, Germany. Live performances of the song were played close to the record and introduced audiences to material from the album, specifically [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1) and [“The Fourth Colour.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-fourth-colour?artist_id=1) While “The Castle In The Air” and “Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet” would be played by the band later in the year, “Polygondwanaland” was never put alongside them. In an [interview for Eleven PDX Magazine](https://issuu.com/elevenpdx/docs/elevenpdx8.1issuu) Stu mentioned that the song was hard to arrange for live shows because it wasn’t made as an entire band.
The Castle in the Air
“The Castle In The Air” stands out from its first few seconds with Leah Senior narrating from the perspective of a traveler to Polygondwanaland, making it the only song on the album to feature her. From there, the complexity builds with twisting acoustic guitar lines and gravelly vocal harmonies. “The Castle In The Air” is the second song in a three track suite of [“Polygondwanaland”](https://kglw.net/song/polygondwanaland?artist_id=1) > “The Castle In The Air” > [“Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet.”](https://kglw.net/song/deserted-dunes-welcome-weary-feet?artist_id=1) 


On April 3rd, 2017, a Facebook user named Blinky Bill [posted a link in a King Gizzard fan group](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/63az0v/hype_train_new_album_polygondwanaland/) to a playlist of demos on Soundcloud called “Polygondwanaland”, the first indication of the existence of the project. Included in the demos was [“Polygondwanaland I+II+III”]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXPJHtN2nCE)) with a runtime of nine minutes and ten seconds. While the track was named “Polygondwanaland,” it contained the entire run of songs including “The Castle in the Air” which appears close to the album version, just without lyrics and synthesizers. The studio version of the track was recorded by Casey Harnett at Flightless HQ and released on November 17th, 2017 as part of *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)*.  The opening narration from Leah Senior would be referenced on the album’s cover. In 2021 “The Castle in the Air” would be name dropped in the song [“Dreams”](https://kglw.net/song/dreams?artist_id=1) with a depiction of said castle making it into the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbUvwyokv_E) for [“Ya Love.”](https://kglw.net/song/ya-love?artist_id=1) 


The earliest recorded performance was on [2018-5-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-may-24-2018-theatre-royal-castlemaine-australia.html) at the Theatre Royal in Castlemaine, Victoria (without acoustic guitar) alongside “Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet,” though their placements were reversed compared to the album. This would create a medley of material from the end of 2017: [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1) > [“The Fourth Colour”](https://kglw.net/song/the-fourth-colour?artist_id=1) > “Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet” > “The Castle In The Air” > [“Muddy Water.”](https://kglw.net/song/muddy-water?artist_id=1) On stage “The Castle In The Air” would be shortened to only a bit over a minute to make a quick change into “Muddy Water.” Since its debut it has served its role within sets but has not been played since [2019-11-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-november-21-2019-modern-sky-lab-shanghai-china.html) at the Modern Sky Lab in Shanghai.

Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet
The travelers of the narrative find the place they’ve been looking for and begin to make it their home to the worry of its natives. Their world of dinosaurs and unnamed creatures is now being inhabited by others. “Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet” is a song with colonialism at its core though its place in time is vague and without a true historical comparison. As [Joey said to SPIN](https://www.spin.com/2023/06/king-gizzard-petrodragonic/)  “there’s dinosaurs in Polygondwanaland, right? It just feels evocative to place it not then, not now, not in the future, but everywhere all at once.”


“Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet” was heard by dedicated fans before it was officially released as part of a leak released on April 3rd, 2017. A Facebook user named Blinky Bill posted a link to a playlist called “Polygondwanaland” on Soundcloud. Included were a number of demos including “Polygondwanaland I+II+III” at nine minutes and ten seconds. The track was the entire [“Polygondwanaland”](https://kglw.net/song/polygondwanaland?artist_id=1) suite including “Deserted Dunes.” LIke the rest of the suite the song is instrumental and lacking synthesizers but is mostly there. The one major difference is that the outro kicks in sooner and lacks its familiar bassline. The studio version of the song was recorded by Casey Harnett at Flightless HQ. The song was released on November 17th, 2017 on *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)*. 


The earliest performance on record was on [2018-5-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-may-24-2018-theatre-royal-castlemaine-australia.html) at the Theatre Royal in Castlemaine, Victoria alongside [“The Castle In The Air”](https://kglw.net/song/the-castle-in-the-air?artist_id=1) with “Deserted Dunes” trading spaces as part of a medley of late 2017 work: [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1) > [“The Fourth Colour”](https://kglw.net/song/the-fourth-colour?artist_id=1) > “Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet” > “The Castle In The Air” > [“Muddy Water.”](https://kglw.net/song/muddy-water?artist_id=1) Unlike the studio version, live performances of the track do not feature acoustic guitar. Since May of 2018 the song has not moved from this medley and was last played on [2019-11-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-november-21-2019-modern-sky-lab-shanghai-china.html) at the Modern Sky Lab in Shanghai.

Inner Cell
Some time after settling into Polygondwanaland, the travelers make plans to kill the ruler of the lands and infiltrate the “inner cell.” They meet secretly within the darkness of the night to create a plan, yet little do they know that this plan won’t go well. “Inner Cell” is the first track of [Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)’s second side and is the first track of a suite of songs sung by Joey referred to as the [“Horology”](https://kglw.net/song/horology?artist_id=1) trilogy. As the start of the trilogy, “Inner Cell” serves as an introduction to the darkest elements of *Polygondwanaland* with its plodding pace and lyrics of rebellion, yet it debuted later than other tracks from the album.

“Inner Cell” was recorded by Casey Harnett at Flightless HQ with additional parts done by Stu and Joey. These sessions can be found within *[polygondwanaland the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuKVgQB8azg)* where Joey can be found singing the final line of the song and adding a synth part. The song first appeared with the release of *Polygondwanaland* on November 17th, 2017 with gentle acoustic guitars and airy synths.

While releasing in 2017, it would not be performed until at least [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne). At this show was the first known performance of the trilogy, which has remained with them ever since and even made it to the concert film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* (recorded on [2019-10-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-6-2019-tivolivredenburg-ronda-utrecht-netherlands.html)) and its accompanying soundtrack. On extremely rare occasions “Inner Cell” was taken out and replaced with [“Cyboogie.”](https://kglw.net/song/cyboogie?artist_id=1) The suite was in heavy rotation throughout 2019 before vanishing in 2020 and 2021. In a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6pumh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Lucas said that the “Horology” trilogy was the hardest song the band had to play live. In [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6uo2e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) he elaborated: “Blocking some parts / instruments out and only listening to some is really hard. There's parts where I have to kind of ignore/tune cavs out which really goes against everything you learn about playing with people.” On [2022-05-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-21-2022-kemba-live-columbus-oh-usa.html) at KEMBA Live in Columbus, Ohio the trilogy reappeared and has stayed in rotation since, becoming the most frequent *Polygondwanaland* material outside of [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1) > [“The Fourth Colour.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-fourth-colour?artist_id=1) Both [Cavs](https://youtu.be/tMxYSfiqNjk?si=NQS6LBCrcaA7-eFj&t=1199) and [Lucas](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6pumh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) have named the trilogy as some of the hardest material to play.

Loyalty
While the travelers plan their attack on the despot, their target is more than aware of their plan. The omnipotent God of the land sees their lack of a loyalty as a test of strength and begins to plan their punishment. As the second song in the [“Horology”](https://kglw.net/song/horology?artist_id=1) trilogy, “Loyalty” hints at the fate of Polygondwanaland’s unwelcome guests. It also has been a highlight of many live shows with Stu taking to the vocoder to sing some terrifying lyrics. “Loyalty” is *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)* at its most ominous and eerie, the surreal calm before a storm. In a way it’s also an important song signaling the band’s synth experimentation to come on *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)* and later *[Butterfly 3000](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)*, though neither project gets as dark as this.

“Loyalty” was recorded by Stu Mackenzie at Flightless HQ  Footage of Stu and Joey recording their vocals for the song during these sessions can be found in *[polygondwanaland the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuKVgQB8azg)* uploaded on November 29th, 2019. While the song would be released on November 17th, 2017, the earliest performance was two years later on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne) as part of the “Horology” trilogy, which would become a staple of the 2019 tours over the next few months. The “Horology” trilogy from [2019-10-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-6-2019-tivolivredenburg-ronda-utrecht-netherlands.html) at the TivoliVredenburg Ronda in Utrecht is at the end of the concert film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. Live performances at the time featured Stu on vocoder for the lines “this is a test, I am lord, I am death” before the final verse. The song would not be played from 2020 to 2021 with [Lucas saying](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6pumh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the trilogy was the hardest song the band had to play live. In [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6uo2e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) he would explain why more in depth. “Blocking some parts / instruments out and only listening to some is really hard. There's parts where I have to kind of ignore/tune cavs out which really goes against everything you learn about playing with people.” “Loyalty” returned as part of the trilogy on [2022-05-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-21-2022-kemba-live-columbus-oh-usa.html) at KEMBA Live in Columbus, Ohio. The vocoder was switched out for an octave effect in these versions. The trilogy would return in 2023, this time with Stu and Joey throat singing the vocoder lines. The “Horology” trilogy is now one of the two common *Polygondwanaland* live choices, the other being [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1) > [“The Fourth Colour.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-fourth-colour?artist_id=1) Both [Cavs](https://youtu.be/tMxYSfiqNjk?si=NQS6LBCrcaA7-eFj&t=1199) and [Lucas](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6pumh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) have named the trilogy as some of the hardest material to play.

Horology
[“Loyalty”](https://kglw.net/song/loyalty?artist_id=1) set up some of the punishments the people of *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)* might face for daring to go against their rulers and “Horology” is that vengeance carried out. As people swarm the fort, they are brutally murdered and tortured. One person makes it out however, their eyes gouged out, now blind. After traveling the lands in search of their family kidnapped by the king, they come across a castle where a man greets them to let them know about a potential cure for their issues: tetrachromacy. The song is the second shortest on the album and is played with a good pace, creating a tense, action packed atmosphere that keeps you on your toes while setting up the next developments in *Polygondwanaland*’s story. It’s the big closer and has been a tough but glorious track in the band’s live shows.

The demo of “Horology” (found on *[Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2)*) is a far cry from its final version as it’s made nearly entirely out of an electronic drum beat, some synths and an acoustic guitar. The demo is short, lasting a total of one minute and thirty five seconds. The studio version of the track was recorded by Casey Harnett at Flightless HQ and would first appear on *Polygondwanaland*, released November 17th, 2017 as a free download and the first official bootlegger album.

The earliest known performance was on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne). The show consisted of many debuts but within the fray was the first [“Inner Cell”](https://kglw.net/song/inner-cell?artist_id=1) > “Loyalty” > “Horology”  in the band’s history. Since then the song has rarely ever left this combination and has made it to some well known places. The “Horology” trilogy as played on [2019-10-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-6-2019-tivolivredenburg-ronda-utrecht-netherlands.html) at the TivoliVredenburg Ronda in Utrecht appears towards the end of the 2020 concert film/soundtrack *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. These three songs were mostly played in 2019 before stopping in 2020/2021. It was reintroduced on [2022-05-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-21-2022-kemba-live-columbus-oh-usa.html) at KEMBA Live in Columbus, Ohio. Since then the trilogy has remained in setlists as one of two common options from *Polygondwanaland*, the other being [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1) > [“The Fourth Colour.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-fourth-colour?artist_id=1) “Horology” as well as the entire trilogy holds a unique title as Lucas said it was the hardest thing the band has to play live in a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6pumh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). “Blocking some parts / instruments out and only listening to some is really hard. There's parts where I have to kind of ignore/tune cavs out which really goes against everything you learn about playing with people.” Both [Cavs](https://youtu.be/tMxYSfiqNjk?si=NQS6LBCrcaA7-eFj&t=1199) and [Lucas](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6pumh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) have named the trilogy as some of the hardest material to play.
Tetrachromacy
Following the merciless deaths of [“Horology,”](https://kglw.net/song/horology?artist_id=1) our protagonist searches for a way to see and remembers about a color beyond human eyesight. They meet a (perhaps familiar) glassy-eyed man who tells them about the secret to see this color, tetrachromacy. The average human eye has three cone types in their retina, each one allowing someone to see different shades of color. Some animals such as sharks, zebra finches and caribou, however, have four different cones which allows them to see new colors that humans typically cannot experience, allowing them to spot things in their environments including ultraviolet light. The protagonist is fascinated by this and yearns to see “the fourth colour.” “Tetrachromacy” sets up a central idea on the album and is the beginning of the album’s final suite. Following the song’s release it would be occasionally referenced such as in [“All Is Known”](https://kglw.net/song/all-is-known?artist_id=1) and [“Dragon.”](https://kglw.net/song/dragon?artist_id=1) 


“Tetrachromacy” was first made known as part of [a Soundcloud leak](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/63az0v/hype_train_new_album_polygondwanaland/) on April 3rd, 2017. In the lineup was a track named “Tetrachromacy I.” While demos for the other *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)* tracks like [“Polygondwanaland”](https://kglw.net/song/polygondwanaland?artist_id=1) and [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1) were saved, “Tetrachromacy” was one of three songs not documented. The studio version of the track was recorded by Casey Harnett at Flightless HQ. The song saw an official release months later on November 17th as part of *Polygondwanaland*. While the song had been a part of one of the band’s 2017 highlights, it did not see a live performance for a very long time. According to [a response from the band](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/o9u3ns/info_from_the_live_chat_predreams/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) before the premiere of the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN-Sr6nPqNo) for [“Dreams”](https://kglw.net/song/dreams?artist_id=1) the song was meant to be played in 2020 but was put to the side due to the shows being canceled. It wasn’t until [2022-05-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-26-2022-higher-ground-showcase-lounge-south-burlington-vt-usa.html) at the Higher Ground Showcase Lounge in South Burlington, Vermont that “Tetrachromacy” would be played, at least based on our knowledge of the band’s setlists. Like other songs from the album it had shed its acoustic skin and was played all electric. It was played one more time on [2022-10-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-14-2022-palace-theatre-st-paul-mn-usa.html) at The Palace Theatre in St. Paul, Minnesota, this time at the beginning of the show, and then was never played again though it was printed on the setlist for [2022-11-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-2-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html).

Searching…
After a look at what tetrachromacy can bring, “Searching…” is a hypnotic look inwards at what the protagonist of *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)* wants: to ascend to the level of a God by seeing [“the fourth colour.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-fourth-colour?artist_id=1) At the end of the track, that’s exactly what they get. The song is the calm before the storm, a moment to breathe before heading right into the ascendant chaos of “The Fourth Colour.” However while the song sits on one of the band’s most beloved albums, “Searching…” has never been in the spotlight. Due to this, there’s a lack of information about it.


The song was recorded by Stu at Flightless HQ. While the song was released on November 17th, 2017, “Searching…” has never been played live. Perhaps there is some insight as to why. Before the premiere of the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN-Sr6nPqNo) for [“Dreams”](https://kglw.net/song/dreams?artist_id=1) [Stu wrote in the live chat](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/o9u3ns/info_from_the_live_chat_predreams/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) “Searching is kind of boring.” It’s unclear whether the song will ever be given more attention.
The Fourth Colour
To wrap up 2017’s *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)* King Gizzard plays “The Fourth Colour.” After searching for the powers of tetrachromacy, the album’s protagonist is finally allowed to see beyond the three cones in their eye and ascends to omnipresence. Reborn as a God, they are allowed to see anything and everything in the universe, though the song’s ending may imply that it’s much uglier than they imagined. While the song starts as a fast paced prog-rock song, it evolves into an ambient synth piece before hitting the listener with a chaotic psychedelic rock freak out with the sound of the band screaming over the shrieking guitars. In retrospect the song is a fitting end to *Polygondwanaland*. The album was released as the first official bootlegger album on November 17th, 2017 for free. This song celebrates the newfound freedom of its protagonist who is now unchained from their previous limitations.

Surprisingly the roots of the song are the earliest out of any of the Polygondwanaland material. An early version of the song can be heard in Jason Galea’s compilation documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w)* which was uploaded to YouTube in November of 2016. Based on other material shown at the beginning of the video and its location, we can assume that this was from upstate New York at the time the band was working out *[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)* and *[Quarters!](https://kglw.net/discography/quarters)*. The early version of the song was played in standard tuning compared to the final version (played in C#) with no lyrics whatsoever. More archival footage of the song can be found in *[polygondwanaland the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuKVgQB8azg)* which features Stu playing guitar for the outro and a full band jam. The track would be recorded at Tender Trap Studios in Northcote by Ryan K. Brennan alongside “Crumbling Castle” and would appear officially when *Polygondwanaland* released in late 2017. Vinyl copies of the album have a unique ending for the song. Past the “freak out” portion of the song the confused cyborg Han-Tyumi says “hello.”

The earliest known performance wouldn’t happen until the following year on [2018-02-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-18-2018-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne), the same day [“Polygondwanaland’](https://kglw.net/song/polygondwanaland?artist_id=1) was also apparently played for the first time. Live performances of the song feature a unique break after the first verse before going into the second chorus and cut out the ending psychedelia entirely. The song early in it’s lifespan was typically part of a three song section of the show dedicated to *Polygondwanaland* material starting with “Polygondwanaland” then moving to [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1) which transitioned into “The Fourth Colour.” At the end of the song the ominous humming synth before the “freak out” section would be played over the speakers before going to [“Robot Stop”](https://kglw.net/song/robot-stop?artist_id=1) and *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* music, though an occasional show like [2018-03-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-1-2018-le-bataclan-paris-france.html) may have a track like [“Cellophane”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane?artist_id=1) afterwards. On March 10th, the song was given a [live music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G5uLFxIj8w) released on March 10th, 2018 which was filmed [2018-03-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-6-2018-paradiso-grote-zaal-amsterdam-netherlands.html) at the Paradiso in Amsterdam.

Starting on [2018-05-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/?date=2018-05-24), “The Fourth Colour” would be incorporated into a long medley of late 2017 songs near the end of the set: “Crumbling Castle” > “The Fourth Colour” > [“Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet”](https://kglw.net/song/deserted-dunes-welcome-weary-feet?artist_id=1) > [“The Castle In The Air”](https://kglw.net/song/the-castle-in-the-air?artist_id=1) > [“Muddy Water.”](https://kglw.net/song/muddy-water?artist_id=1) The only difference between these versions of the song and ones from earlier in the year is that the synth outro was cut out entirely for “Deserted Dunes.” The song was played on [2019-11-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-november-23-2019-fort-canning-park-singapore-singapore.html) at Fort Canning Park in Singapore (this time without the previous three songs following it) before dropping out of sets for the time being. It reappeared in the same form on [2022-10-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-2-2022-william-randolph-hearst-greek-theatre-berkeley-ca-usa.html) at the Greek Theatre marathon show and has stayed with Gizzard ever since. For those wondering why the end of the song was never played live, the band doesn’t know either. Before the YouTube premiere for the [“Dreams”](https://kglw.net/song/dreams?artist_id=1) [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN-Sr6nPqNo), [Stu wrote in chat](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/o9u3ns/info_from_the_live_chat_predreams/?share_id=wWu-lPg9iNLrxqKN7ylH0&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) “Yes, we should def do the fourth colour Outro. Dunno why we’ve never done that.”

Gumboot Soup
Beginner’s Luck
“Beginner’s Luck” follows someone deciding to play a game of poker at a casino for the first time. They’re told that beginner’s luck is on their side, and that even if they lose, it’s cheaper than a drink. The game that follows is described with wordplay based around poker terminology such as burned/washed cards, “betting skins,” as well as bluffing. The game doesn’t go well for the amateur and they decide that the only way they can win is by spooking — a cheat which exposes face down cards on the table. They’re caught in the act by security as their luck turned out to be a lie. The song is a light psychedelic pop track with flutes, Mellotron and plucky synths. Musically there are hints of late-era Beatles, as well as the session work of Bernard Purdie through the track’s extensive use of the Purdie Shuffle. It also features a distinct bass line, one which Lucas has called his [favorite](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnr15to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to play.

When asked if the song was inspired by a trip to Las Vegas during the *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnr6315/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Cavs agreed though jokingly mentioned that it’s because Stu is a gambling addict. Stu [responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnrus2x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), saying “it’s sad.” The liner notes state that Ambrose (vocals), Cavs (drums), Lucas (piano) and Stu (vocals/guitar/keyboards/bass/percussion) played on the studio version and that it was recorded at Flightless HQ by Stu. The final track was mixed by Michael Badger. It was released as a [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLdI44R0RQA) on December 12th, 2017 alongside [“All Is Known.”](https://kglw.net/song/all-is-known?artist_id=1) [According to Jason Galea](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/7lo887/beginners_luck_motu_draft_artwork/), the single artwork was a draft of the art for *[Murder of the Universe’s](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* album cover. The song became the opening track of *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)*, which was released on December 31st, 2017.

In an interview for [Eleven PDX Magazine](https://issuu.com/elevenpdx/docs/elevenpdx8.1issuu), Stu mentioned that “Beginner’s Luck” was soundchecked throughout their 2018 European Tour before they ever played it. The earliest documented performance of the song was on [2018-03-03](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-3-2018-laeronef-lille-france.html) at L'aeronef in Lille. The song would then be played a few other times in 2018. These versions were faster, featured a different groove, were typically longer, and (at least occasionally) featured Malcolm Brown of the band Whitney on keys while Ambrose and Stu sang without their instruments. While the song had started as a late set track, it soon became a show closer — a spot it would not see past this point. “Beginner’s Luck” was played more often in 2019, starting with a show on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). A performance of the song from [2019-10-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-16-2019-x-tra-zrich-switzerland.html) was used as a bonus feature for *Chunky Shrapnel*. As of writing, this was the final performance of the song. 2019 live versions of “Beginner’s Luck” are longer than the studio version with an extended intro featuring soulful vocals from Stu (now on keys) and extended outro guitar and keyboard solos.

Greenhouse Heat Death
Channeling sounds of stoner and doom metal is “Greenhouse Heat Death”, a microtonal track with growling and guttural vocals over a heavy wah-wah drenched guitar groove, and even some synth work. While its title is a reference to the [heat death of the universe](https://www.physlink.com/education/askexperts/ae181.cfm) (the proposed point at which all energy in the universe has dissipated into heat), the lyrics describe how Earth is warming due to [greenhouse gasses emitted into our atmosphere](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases). The song uses food metaphors to explain the situation; Earth is being cooked and fried while humanity is merely “good broth” and “hard yolk.”

A demo of the song was released on *[Demos Vol. 3: Music To Eat Pond Scum To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-3)*. This version is made up entirely of electronic instruments with Mellotron and synth bass parts, though its structure is close to what appears on the final version up until its ending. The end of the second solo section is completely different and features a new, strange melody before leading to a long bass outro that fades out. A second demo was released on the [ATO repress](https://www.discogs.com/release/28981669-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Nonagon-Infinity) of *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)*. This demo was recorded using a different rhythm and key than the final version. It's also longer than the studio version with a jam coming in around the three minute mark that features muted guitar picking akin to the breaks on [“Open Water.”](https://kglw.net/song/open-water?artist_id=1) This was most likely recorded in 2016 during the sessions for *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)* as the track has similarities to other released demos, notably the second demo of [“Sleep Drifter.”](https://kglw.net/song/sleep-drifter?artist_id=1) The *Gumboot Soup* version was played by Cavs (drums), Cook (guitar), Joey (guitar), Lucas (bass) and Stu (guitar/vocals/synthesizer/percussion) and was recorded by Stu at Rada Studios with additional work done at Flightless HQ. Other additional parts were also recorded at Whammy Bar in Auckland which the band played at from [2017-12-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-december-6-2017-whammy-bar-auckland-aotearoa-new-zealand.html) to [2017-12-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-december-11-2017-san-fran-wellington-aotearoa-new-zealand.html). It's one of two songs on the album to be mixed by Joey. “Greenhouse Heat Death” initially debuted on [Triple R radio](https://www.rrr.org.au/on-demand/archives/1618-king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-banana-lounge-broadcasting) on December 19th, 2017 with [outlets reporting it as](https://music.mxdwn.com/2017/12/19/news/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-releases-dizzying-new-song-greenhouse/) “Greenhouse.” It was released as a [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Npv-UvtJ3w) on December 20th alongside [“The Last Oasis”](https://kglw.net/song/the-last-oasis?artist_id=1) and sequenced as the second song on *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)* on December 31st.

The earliest known performance of “Greenhouse Heat Death” was on [2018-02-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-18-2018-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). At the start of the year it was typically played as the second song of the first set behind [“Rattlesnake”](https://kglw.net/song/rattlesnake?artist_id=1), but by May the song had been pushed further back in the show. Its last two appearances on [2018-06-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-11-2018-majestic-theatre-detroit-mi-usa.html) and [2018-06-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-16-2018-brooklyn-steel-brooklyn-ny-usa.html) saw it return back to the beginning of the gig. Since then “Greenhouse Heat Death” has not been played live.

Barefoot Desert
With songwriting credits for Ambrose, Cook and Stu, “Barefoot Desert” is a vibrant track about someone walking across the desert without any shoes. The narrator makes it clear that they were told not to go barefoot, but through their own ignorance, they decided to abandon the advice. Now they’re lost without any protection and they only have themselves to blame. “Barefoot Desert” features a bouncy rhythm overlaid with flutes, Mellotron, chimes and bells. The lyrics are primarily sung by Ambrose, though Cook adds some backing vocals.


Liner notes indicate that Ambrose (vocals), Cavs (drums), Cook (guitar/vocals/keyboards/bass) and Stu (Mellotron/keyboards/flute/percussion) played on the song and that it was largely recorded by Cook on his phone with additions done at Flightless by Stu. The track was also mixed by Stu. It was released on December 31st, 2017 as the third song on *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)*.  


“Barefoot Desert” has not been played live.
Muddy Water
In “Muddy Water,” Stu sings about his distaste for beaches and all of the inconveniences of them. He notes the burning sun, the scorching sand and freezing water and the sharks looking for food as reasons he avoids the ocean. Instead, he opts for the river as his place to relax. Here, he’s allowed to connect with nature in the muddy water. The song also comments on a difference in attitudes. While the beach attracts the vain models and muscle men of the world, the river is messy and unsophisticated. The song, of course, brings to mind [“The River”](https://kglw.net/song/the-river?artist_id=1) from 2015’s *[Quarters!](https://kglw.net/discography/quarters)* but also references one of the band’s earliest tracks [“Summer!”](https://kglw.net/song/summer?artist_id=1) The start of each verse is a direct quote of the track’s lyrics. Behind Stu’s interest in rivers is a rocking syncopated instrumental accented by bagpipe-like saxophone played by Stu, which gives the song a Scottish jig-like rhythm.

A demo for “Muddy Water” was released on *[Demos Vol. 1: Music To Kill Bad People](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-1)*. The track is in a different key and is a jam on the main concept of the song. The structure of the demo doesn’t resemble the final version much and it's shorter than the final version. “Muddy Water” was performed by Ambrose (vocals), Cavs (drums), Joey (guitar), Lucas (bass) and Stu (vocals/guitar/saxophone/flute/percussion/keyboards) and was recorded at Flightless HQ with a mix done by Stu. Additional parts were also recorded at Whammy Bar in Auckland, which the band played at from [2017-12-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-december-6-2017-whammy-bar-auckland-aotearoa-new-zealand.html) to [2017-12-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-december-11-2017-san-fran-wellington-aotearoa-new-zealand.html). It was released on *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)* on December 31st, 2017.

The earliest known performance was on [2018-05-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-may-24-2018-theatre-royal-castlemaine-australia.html) at the Theatre Royal in Castlemaine. Here the song was played as a standalone track. For the rest of the year, however, “Muddy Water” was included in a medley of [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1) > [“The Fourth Colour”](https://kglw.net/song/the-fourth-colour?artist_id=1) > [“Deserted Dunes Welcome Weary Feet”](https://kglw.net/song/deserted-dunes-welcome-weary-feet?artist_id=1) > [“The Castle In The Air”](https://kglw.net/song/the-castle-in-the-air?artist_id=1) > “Muddy Water.” This continued into 2019 though it sometimes appeared on its own ([2019-07-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-6-2019-unsw-roundhouse-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html)). After a couple of electric performances in 2020 and 2021, it reappeared as an acoustic track starting on [2021-12-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-13-2021-brunswick-ballroom-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). In 2022 the standalone electric version returned as the primary version. Outside of the band’s live shows, Cavs played “Muddy Water” at his first [drum seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9O9b-U0nl4&t=1381s) at Drumtek in Northcote in 2022.

Superposition
The only Joey-led song on *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)* is “Superposition.” It is one of the band’s most unique tracks with a hypnotic 5/4 groove, strange woodwind additions and disorienting production. The song is one of the band’s first to dive into the synthesizer as a foundational aspect of a song’s composition — expanded on albums like *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)*, *[Made In Timeland](https://kglw.net/discography/made-in-timeland)* and *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*. The lyrics focus on [quantum superposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition), a scientific principle which describes how a quantum object can exist in multiple places at the same time. Joey sings about superposition as well as moving beyond our current conception of reality to achieve some state of peace. 


The track was played by Cavs (drums), Joey (synthesizer/guitar/bass/vocals/percussion) and Stu (flute/saxophone) with the liner notes saying that it was recorded in Joey’s bedroom. Additional parts were also recorded at Whammy Bar in Auckland which the band played at from [2017-12-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-december-6-2017-whammy-bar-auckland-aotearoa-new-zealand.html) to [2017-12-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-december-11-2017-san-fran-wellington-aotearoa-new-zealand.html). The mix was done by Joey. It saw a release as the fifth song on *Gumboot Soup* on December 31st, 2017. 


“Superposition” has not been played live but it has been teased such as in [“Lava”](https://kglw.net/song/lava?artist_id=1) from [2023-03-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-7-2023-mnchenbryggeriet-stockholm-sweden.html). 
Down The Sink
Characterized by a swinging beat and jazzy instrumentation, “Down the Sink” is the only Cook-sung track on *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)*. Tonally it's reminiscent of *[Sketches of Brunswick East](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)* with marimba, saxophone and flute over a psychedelic pop instrumental. While the song is compositionally bright, the lyrics are bleak. Cook describes city life through chaos and abandonment. He paints the city as a place of constant movement and action but keeps pointing down below the sidewalks. There, as Cook explains, are tons of unfulfilled hopes and dreams that are left behind for the hustle of downtown living. The second verse shows how the pace of this life disconnects us from ourselves as we fight over food while “cops patrol the alleys.” The tagline of the song sums up the conflicts of the city perfectly: “the street is where people live, the street is where people die.”


“Down the Sink” was played by Ambrose (vocals), Cavs (drums), Cook (guitar/vocals/keyboards/bass/Mellotron) and Stu (keyboards/saxophone/flute/Mellotron) and was recorded on Cook’s phone with additional parts added by Stu at Flightless HQ. The final song was also mixed by Stu. It was released on December 31st, 2017.

The earliest known performance was on [2019-08-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-23-2019-riverside-theater-milwaukee-wi-usa.html) at The Riverside Theater in Milwaukee. The song was played five times throughout the year before taking a hiatus. It returned on [2022-05-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-24-2022-water-street-music-hall-rochester-ny-usa.html) for its only performance that year. Since then it has been a relatively rare track with a handful of appearances. 2023 performances are heavier than the prior versions, with wobbly lead synth and distorted guitar.

The Great Chain Of Being
The [great chain of being](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Great-Chain-of-Being) (scala naturae) is a concept found in Christianity which explains a hierarchy within all life. At the top of the chain is God, angels rest a level below, the human life follows with animals a tier lower. We then get to plants before the final link: minerals and other Earthly matter. In the song “The Great Chain Of Being,” however, Stu sings about someone or something attacking this order of life. They describe themselves as a “rock with eyes to the sky” that has fallen out of a woman’s coat pocket. In the great chain of being they sit at the lowest level, however they aspire to disrupt the hierarchy by ascending to the highest plane of being, re-making the chain entirely. While it could be read as a story of rebirth, it could also be seen as commentary on climate change where Earth will ultimately reign supreme over religion and belief. Beside the song’s layered meaning, “The Great Chain Of Being” is one of the band’s earliest metal songs with stylistic similarities to stoner metal bands like Sleep and Kyuss, though [Stu is reluctant to give it such a label](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3eXD0OvGJKyooFuLlNPbwh?si=ee56f985fc974022). 


Stu explained “The Great Chain of Being” to [Guitar World](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/the-10-best-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-songs-so-far). “That type of music [stoner rock] is something we listen to a lot on tour, especially whilst driving. It definitely started to seep into our subconsciousness. [“The Great Chain Of Being”] is like a road song to me. We were trying to finish the five albums in a year, trying to make things varied and trying to experiment with recording as well. I think the recording is slowed down on the tape machine. We were messing around a lot at this point, and it was the fifth record of the five. We thought, ‘Let’s just try everything’. I think it allowed us to be super free and be open. In a lot of ways, each song just felt lower-stakes, therefore you can take more risks — which was the point of the five records, just to see how many risks we could take. Obviously not everything is going to pay off, but some of my favorite songs I’ve ever written came out of that year.” The song was played by the entire band: Ambrose (synthesizer), Cavs (drums), Cook (guitar), Eric/Mu (drums), Joey (guitar), Lucas (bass) and Stu (guitar/vocals/synthesizer). It was recorded by Stu at Rada Studios and Flightless HQ with the final mix being done by Michael Badger. “The Great Chain Of Being” was released as part of *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)* on December 31st. The song was later referenced on the *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)* song [“Flamethrower”](https://kglw.net/song/flamethrower?artist_id=1) which adapts the phrase “I disrupt natural order.”

The earliest known performance of “The Great Chain Of Being” was on [2018-11-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-november-23-2018-enmore-theatre-sydney-australia.html) at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney. Only played a few times that year, these versions are generally faster than the studio version. It was played heavily throughout 2019 at a slower pace than before. After two performances in 2020, the song wasn’t played in 2021. When it returned in 2022, the song was played in a heavier style as the band changed the key from C# to B. The song was performed a decent amount throughout the year but slowed down considerably in 2023. While it is typically played on its own, a performance of [“Gaia”](https://kglw.net/song/gaia) > [“Motor Spirit”](https://kglw.net/song/motor-spirit) > “The Great Chain of Being” > “Gaia” on [2023-06-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-11-2023-the-salt-shed-chicago-il-usa.html) demonstrated that the rule could be broken.

The Last Oasis
“The Last Oasis” is a jazzy psychedelic track that follows someone trying to find water in a hot, desert world. The narrator sees a mirage and dubs it the last oasis — a rare sight that provides a sense of safety, though it's only a dream. While it largely focuses on the desert, the song also makes a few references to outer space by comparing the mirage to a lost astronaut, and name dropping the astrophysicist [Thomas Zurbuchen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Zurbuchen). The track utilizes marimba and Mellotron as well as distinct production to give it a laid back vibe, though the song ends on an ominous note, both musically and lyrically.

The song was played by Ambrose (vocals), Cavs (drums), Joey (bass), Lucas (keyboards) and Stu (vocals/keyboards/Mellotron) with recording done at Flightless HQ by Stu. It was mixed by Michael Badger. “The Last Oasis” was dropped as a [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF_eiMLG9Ho) alongside [“Greenhouse Heat Death”](https://kglw.net/song/greenhouse-heat-death?artist_id=1) on December 20th, 2017 and saw a final release on *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)* on December 31st.


“The Last Oasis” has not been played live.
All Is Known
Opening with an atmospheric microtonal intro before heading straight into a hard-rocking garage rock track, “All Is Known” comments on the threats humanity may face at the hands of artificial general intelligence. The lyrics detail a digital being connected to a mainframe of information who argues that humanity should be destroyed, as they’ve become outdated and superseded by cybernetic technology. The song brings to mind other narrative pieces from 2017: notably [“Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe”](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe) as well as [“Tetrachromacy,”](https://kglw.net/song/tetrachromacy?artist_id=1) which is referenced in the third verse. Around the time “All Is Known” was first being shown to the public, [Stu mentioned](https://observer.com/2017/04/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-interview/) his concern about the powers of a sentient A.I. “I don’t know, I’ve been reading a lot of things lately. Some people say, a *lot* of people say that humanity’s greatest threat may be, at this point in time, A.I.”

Two demos of the song have been released, the first on *[Demos Vol. 3: Music To Eat Pond Scum To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-3)*. This track is very different from the final studio cut as it's a jam on the breakdown section heard at the end of the studio version. The second demo appeared on *[Demos Vol. 6: Music To Burn Money To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-6-music-to-burn-money-to)*, and is a jam on the body of the song at a slower pace. This version features the breakdown heard in the first demo with the same placement of the final version. King Gizzard played the song live as early as [2017-03-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-19-2017-the-night-cat-melbourne-australia.html) at The Night Cat in Naarm (Melbourne). These early versions feature different lyrics and do not include the long intro of the final track. As for the studio version, “All Is Known” was performed by all members of the band: Ambrose (vocals/harmonica/keyboards), Cavs (drums), Cook, (guitar), Eric/Mu (drums) Joey (guitar), Lucas (bass) and Stu (guitar/vocals/saxophone/percussion). The song was recorded at Flightless HQ and mixed by Stu. A [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxlUl6dVxPk) for “All Is Known” dropped alongside [“Beginner’s Luck”](https://kglw.net/song/beginners-luck?artist_id=1) on December 12th, 2017. It saw a final release as part of *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)* on December 31st.

Following the release of *Gumboot Soup*, the earliest known performance of the the studio version was on [2018-02-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-18-2018-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). The song was played often throughout the year during the microtonal portion of their shows and has become a decently common track since with appearances every year. “All Is Known” is often played as a standalone song, though it has been added to medleys such as on [2022-10-10](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-10-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html) where it transitioned into [“Straws In The Wind.”](https://kglw.net/song/straws-in-the-wind?artist_id=1)

I’m Sleepin’ In
“I’m Sleepin’ In” is a mid-tempo track with a chill groove fleshed out through harmonica, guitar and Mellotron. It also features some of the most unique production on *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)* with the track speeding up and slowing down at different times, giving it a dreamlike quality. Lyrically the song is simple, commenting on how Stu needs to rest after so much work. [Stu has stated](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/gumboot-soup) that the creation of *Gumboot Soup* tested the band’s patience after a year of constant movement. “Ahh yes. I really pushed everyone (including myself) to breaking point here. Much of this was recorded on the road between shows in hotels, venues or cheap studios on days off. I think I was the only one with my heart still in it by the end; I could tell the other 6 gizzards really just wanted to take a break. It was December after all and we’d played like 100 shows and written and recorded probably 50 songs. Everyone was real pissed off at me that’s for sure. SORRY!...” Some of that energy may have rubbed off onto the track and its sleepy nature.


The song has the least amount of credits of any song on *Gumboot Soup*, with only Ambrose (harmonica/vocals) and Stu (vocals/drums/keyboards/Mellotron/guitar/bass/percussion) playing on the track. It was recorded and mixed by Stu at Flightless HQ and released on December 31st, 2017.


“I’m Sleepin’ In” has not been played live.
The Wheel
The final song of *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)* (and the band’s five albums from 2017) is “The Wheel.” Taking influences from jazz and psychedelic rock, it's the longest tune on the album while also containing some of the most thoughtful and meaningful lyrics. The choruses (sung by Stu) describe how we “fall asleep” with the future ahead of us, while the verses (sung by Ambrose) examine how we live our lives passively or even without sympathy. The first verse notes how we see those who need help but decline to offer a hand, even if it would collectively lead us to a better world. The second verse tells of “shivering pilgrims” who attempt to achieve their idealized version of death by ending on their own terms. We’re all traveling to that inevitable end point and we want it to end in our own ways though this may never happen if we refuse to help each other. The third and final verse notes how society is under stress and that division will be our downfall. The wheel itself is a guiding force, a way into the future we want, but one we actively fail to control. For us to steer a path through the unstoppable march of time, there must be action. Ultimately the lyrics can be interpreted in a number of ways. While one may view it as a song about neglecting the future, another may see it as a song [rooted in Hegelian philosophy](https://genius.com/King-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-the-wheel-lyrics). The song’s deep, existential lyrics paired with the somber and emotional music creates a perfect end note for both *Gumboot Soup* and 2017 as a whole.


Ambrose (vocals), Cavs (drums), Joey (bass), Lucas (keyboards) and Stu (vocals/keyboards/percussion) played on the song, which was recorded and mixed by Stu at Flightless HQ. It saw a release on *Gumboot Soup* on December 31st, 2017. On vinyl pressings the song ends with a locked groove, meaning that the final moments of the music loop continuously until you lift the needle, making a clever interactive metaphor for the meaning of the song.

The earliest known performance of “The Wheel” was on [2018-05-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-may-24-2018-theatre-royal-castlemaine-australia.html) at the Theatre Royal in Castlemaine. The song was played heavily throughout 2018, though live renditions were shorter than the studio version. In 2019 the song was only played three times with the runtime extending beyond the five minute mark ([2019-10-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-9-2019-ancienne-belgique-brussels-belgium.html)). A clip of the band soundchecking the song during their 2019 European Tour was featured in the film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. After a two year break, “The Wheel” returned as an acoustic track on [2021-12-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-13-2021-brunswick-ballroom-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) and [2021-12-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-19-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html). The song took another break in 2022, returning to setlists for a few performances in 2023. These were the longest versions yet, with runtimes hitting upwards of nine minutes.

Fishing For Fishies
Fishing For Fishies
The title track of *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)* is an upbeat song with country-twang guitars and a drum beat like a rolling train. The lyrics are straightforward — a simple denouncement of recreational fishing, arguing that fish would be better off swimming unharmed than hooked for sport.  
When asked what inspired the song/album title, [Stu wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3h0vz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) “hunting makes me sad” — a simple encapsulation of the track’s purpose. The vocals are split between Stu and Ambrose, with Stu taking the verses and post-choruses, and Ambrose adding the bridges and choruses. While the lyrics are simple, the music uses intricate guitar riffs, a walking bassline, and two different drum parts.

A demo for the song was released on *[Demos Vol. 1: Music To Kill Bad People To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-1)*. An instrumental with a different groove than the final version, as well as alternate riffs and a different structure (the “I don’t want to be fishing for fish” melodic lines are notably missing), it also features a [“Cut Throat Boogie”](https://kglw.net/song/cut-throat-boogie)-esque break, which Ambrose is heard faintly singing or playing harmonica over. In an [interview for RockZone](https://issuu.com/rockzonemag/docs/rz_158) Stu mentioned that the song came out of a jam. Liner notes state that “Fishing For Fishies” was recorded at TFS Studios by Gareth Liddiard in May of 2018, with additional overdubs by Cook and Stu in Melbourne from July to November. Cavs (drums), Eric (drums), Stu (vocals/electric guitar/Mellotron/keyboards), Ambrose (vocals/harmonica), Cook (bass/electric guitar) and Joey (electric guitar) would all play on the track, which was mixed by Sam Joseph. Footage from the TFS sessions was included in *[How to gut a Fishie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWLhIZpJUAs&t=574s)*. From these shots, we see that Cavs had a hard time doing the part and chose to split it with Eric who took the fills. The title track of *Fishing For Fishies* saw a release on April 26th, 2019. The song was later [featured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjuygXbRpLc&t=150s) in the 2020 video game *[Sackboy: A Big Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sackboy:_A_Big_Adventure)*. According to the band’s [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6rhq0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), they were asked for the instrumental stems, although they had lost the files. The audio heard in the game was created by Sumo Digital using AI splitting tools.

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beIDKFwXam0) for the song by Jason Galea was released on March 11th, 2019. It shows Stu (wearing a yellow long sleeve shirt, overalls and a black helmet) waking up on a raft and fishing. He is joined by small versions of the rest of the band in red outfits with white helmets decorated with two cartoon-y eyes, who play the song on seashell-decorated guitars and conch shells. Stu dives into the water to find a pearl and another decorated guitar, which he plays alongside animated fish. Continuing on his raft, Stu and the band go down a river accompanied by fish playing flutes and the gator seen in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUZn1I6llJs) for [“The River.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-river?artist_id=1) The director of photography was John Angus Stewart, who would go on to work with the band on other music videos (notably the next three videos from the band for *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)*) as well as films like *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* and *Sleeping Monster*. Some of the props from the video (the fish statue and Joey’s guitar) were put on display at the Flightless 168 store following the video’s release, and also appeared during the [Record Store Day sale](https://nicksnews.home.blog/2019/04/19/record-store-day-at-flightless-hq/) at Flightless HQ. Iconography from the video would be referenced on show posters such as for [2019-07-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-5-2019-unsw-roundhouse-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html) and .[2019-07-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-13-2019-astor-theatre-perth-wa-australia.html) as well as the cover for *Demos Vol. 1 + [Vol. 2](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2)*. [Behind the scenes photos](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvJUnYYAGJh/) from the shoot were [uploaded](https://www.instagram.com/p/BvjE1GNgqI4/) throughout March to Jason Galea’s Instagram.


“Fishing For Fishies” has never been played live and is the only song from the album not to see the stage. It was, however, meant to appear on tour in 2019. In a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnqh9ch/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Stu said “we rehearsed FFF but it sounded shit haha. We'll try again next tour.” Lucas [repeated this](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6rb4h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) later that year, saying that the band had attempted to play the song but that it “sounded pretty crap.” In their [2022 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i89p4x3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Ambrose said that he hoped they would eventually play the track. While Gizzard has yet to play the track, Cavs gave it a shot during his [drum seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9O9b-U0nl4&t=1381s) at Drumtek in Northcote.
Boogieman Sam
The second song on *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)* is a raunchy boogie that introduces us to a character named Boogieman Sam. He is defined by chaos — eating babies, shooting cops and “causing mayhem.” While the song can be read as a description of one person, the band may be commenting on humanity at large in all of its ugliness, using the boogieman (bogeyman) to blame for all of society’s ills. The song is often dedicated to the band’s soundman Sam Joseph, who also mixed a lot of *Fishing For Fishies* including this song.

Stu explained the song’s origins and its music in an interview with [Guitar World](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/the-10-best-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-songs-so-far). “It’s in drop D which is pretty rare for us, though it’s not in D. The tuning just allows us to do that riff. Maybe if you had really long fingers you could do it, but I need to be in drop D to play that one. It was one of the middle songs to come together for that record, and it’s just a really fun jam and a fun live song that gets a bit loose and stands out a bit. I’m not a fingerpicker, it’s not the way I learnt to play... I just use clawhammer — my thumb and my first finger — and I think it’s just because I’m bad at it. That solo is just played on a single string. I don’t even know how it came together, it was just like, ‘This sounds funny, let’s do this!’” During a [RockZone interview](https://issuu.com/rockzonemag/docs/rz_158) Stu said the final recording of the song is close to the demos and early versions they played. Liner notes state that “Boogieman Sam” was recorded at TFS Studios in May of 2018 by Gareth Liddiard, with additional overdubs in Melbourne recorded by Cook and Stu in a span of July to November. The song has recording credits for Ambrose (vocals/harmonica/Mellotron), Cavs (drums), Joey (bass), Cook (electric guitar) and Stu (electric guitar/vocals/Mellotron/bass/drums/claps/keyboards/shaker). The band released “Boogieman Sam” as a [single](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kE1S9olY6A) on March 28th, 2019 (the third song released from *Fishing For Fishies*) with a final release on April 26th, 2019.

“Boogieman Sam” debuted on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne) and became a common song throughout the year. These versions were typically longer than the album version by a few minutes, reaching five to seven minutes in length. The song was played two times in 2020 before taking a break. The Boogieman reappeared on [2022-03-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) for the Return of the Curse of Timeland festival, after which it would go back to being a common track. Unlike 2019 appearances, however, post-COVID takes on “Boogieman Sam” were longer with some performances going as long as thirteen minutes (see [2023-06-03](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-3-2023-the-caverns-above-ground-amphitheater-pelham-tn-usa.html) with teases of classic blues and boogie songs. While played less in 2023, it remained in the band’s roster with a decent amount of exposure throughout the year.

The Bird Song
Stu [described](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3d0jd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the song as a “series of questions” centered on spread 4th chord voicings. It’s hard to put it better than that. “The Bird Song” is a bright track where Stu asks existential questions about nature’s reaction to humanity's industrialized society, such as “to a bird what’s a plane?” and “to a tree what’s a house?” The answers to these questions are vague, open-ended or not answers at all (“is that even relevant?”). Following a steady rhythm and bass line with harp and orchestral flourishes, the track is upbeat yet makes us ask questions of ourselves concerning our relationship with the world around us.

The song started as a simple guitar idea [according to Stu](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3gzlq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) but would become a tough song to get down. In a [2019 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3bdff/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Stu mentioned that it took the band multiple attempts to get “The Bird Song” right. A year later he [expanded upon this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnqbphz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), saying that they had recorded four different takes of the song with the final one being the version they used. Two of these alternate takes have been released. The first, on *[Demos Vol. 1: Music To Kill Bad People To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-1)*, starts with a swinging yet soft hi-hat driven section followed by a very reserved take on the song’s structure, with an electric organ playing a variation on the vocal melody. This version has some structural differences but is quite close to the final version. The second appeared on *[Demos Vol. 4: Music to Die To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-4)* and is close to the first with an added guitar part on top of the instrumental, as well as a new ending. This take gets even closer to the studio version, but is still off in a number of ways. Footage of the band playing the song in its early demo form can be seen in *[How to gut a Fishie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWLhIZpJUAs)*. The liner notes for *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)* indicate that the studio version of “The Bird Song” was recorded entirely at Flightless HQ in September 2018 by Stu, with overdubs recorded by Cook and Stu lasting until November. The final version was mixed by Sam Joseph and removes the fast jazz groove heard in the demos, replacing it with a more straightforward rhythm. Played by Stu (piano/vocals/Mellotron/flute/bass/organ), Cavs (drums/conga/tambourine) and Cook (bass), “The Bird Song” would be released after much work as the third song on *Fishing For Fishies* on April 26th, 2019.

“The Bird Song” made its live debut on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) and was played throughout 2019 as a standalone song, though often played next to [“This Thing.”](https://kglw.net/song/this-thing?artist_id=1) It was performed once in 2020 on [2020-02-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-9-2020-esplanade-reserve-fremantle-wa-australia.html) but was never played again. A quick soundcheck of the song was featured in *[RATTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AzPaId5Qc&t=1272s)* alongside a brief discussion about how the crowd reacts to it.
Plastic Boogie
“[Plastic is] potentially the biggest ecological disaster we've created” said Stu in a [2019 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3ey7e/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).  “We've gotta stop using it completely, I think. It's possible. We've really been using it heavily since the ‘60s.” To put our use of plastic into perspective, we produce over [four hundred million tonnes a year](https://www.unep.org/interactives/beat-plastic-pollution/) according to the UN. The result of that is plastic everywhere, from landfills to oceans, where an estimated [eight million metric tonnes](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/marinedebris/plastics-in-the-ocean.html) is held. But plastic isn’t just showing up in the water— it’s also showing up in our own bodies. In 2020 [scientists found microplastics in the placentas of unborn babies](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/22/microplastics-revealed-in-placentas-unborn-babies) and two years later they found microplastics in [human blood](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/microplastics-found-in-human-blood-for-first-time) for the first time. King Gizzard commented on our dependency on plastic with a song called “Plastic Boogie.” It’s an uncomplicated boogie with crowd vocals, a bouncy rhythm and explicit lyrics with the simple, repeated phrase “fuck all of that plastic.”  


“Plastic Boogie” was the first song worked on for *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)*. The album’s liner notes show that the song was primarily recorded at Flightless HQ in January of 2018 by Stu, with added drum parts done at TFS Studios in May under the supervision of Gareth Liddiard. There were also overdubs going from July to November in Melbourne recorded by Stu. Ambrose (harmonica/vocals), Cavs (drums/tambourine), Cook (vocals), Joey (bass/shaker/vocals), Lucas (vocals/shaker) and Stu (electric guitar/vocals/flute) played on the final track and it’s the only song on *Fishing For Fishies* solely mixed by Stu. As for the feminine background vocals, Lucas said during the *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnqzbi8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) “It's all gizz, we all love getting in touch with our feminine side.” “Plastic Boogie” released as the fourth song on *Fishing For Fishies* on April 26th, 2019.

This was the song’s only 2021 performance. Since then the song has become a rare tune in the band’s live rotation.

The Cruel Millennial
Moving away from the environmental themes of *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)*, “The Cruel Millennial” is an Ambrose-led track that comments on the generation gap between millennials and Gen Z exacerbated by the use of new technology. There’s an addiction to phones and computers (demonstrated through the mention of the game *[Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PUBG:_Battlegrounds)*, abbreviated to PUBG), as well as a rise in conspiracy theories and the Mandela Effect: it’s second verse mentioning the [disappearance of white dog feces](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/643437/what-happened-white-dog-poop-used-be-everywhere) and the name of the *[Berenstain Bears](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a7664693/mandela-effect-examples/)*. He comments that, while only born in 1992, he feels old and out of touch with society. While [somewhat divisive](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/ynssb3/whatre_your_guys_thoughts_on_the_cruel_millennial/) within the fanbase, “The Cruel Millennial” is an ultimately lighthearted and self-aware boogie about the changing world.

Liner notes mention that “The Cruel Millennial” had been recorded primarily at Flightless HQ in April of 2018 by Stu, with additional drum parts being done at TFS Studios with Gareth Liddiard in May. A snippet of Ambrose recording harmonica for the song appears in *[How to gut a Fishie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWLhIZpJUAs&t=207s)*. Overdubs were recorded in Melbourne by Stu from July to November. Cavs (drums/conga), Joey (electric guitar), Lucas (bass), Cook (bass), Ambrose (vocals/harmonica/percussion) and Stu (electric guitar/bass/organ/vibraphone) would play on the track, with Sam Joseph mixing the final version. “The Cruel Millennial” was released on *Fishing For Fishies* on April 26th, 2019.

The song debuted on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne). It would be played a handful of other times in 2019, with a final performance on [2019-09-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-4-2019-stubbs-bar-b-q-austin-tx-usa.html) at Stubb's Bar-B-Q in Austin. Since then the song hasn’t been played, with no talk of it returning.
Real’s Not Real
“Real’s Not Real” starts as a fuzzy and loud rock song with a driving rhythm before breaking into a Beatles-esque verse where Stu reflects on someone’s worldview. While they paint themselves as happy, the truth is that they are afraid of change and action to a point where they can never be pleased. Their perception of themselves — and by extension reality — isn’t real. The second verse focuses broadly on humanity, arguing that in the face of climate change we need to unify and abandon our own egos and sacred cows (uncriticizable beliefs) to stop, or at least mitigate, the effects.

A demo for “Real’s Not Real” was released as part of the benefit album *[Woman Life Freedom — Music For Iran, Volume 2](https://kglw.net/discography/Musicforiran)*. It’s a low fidelity instrumental take with an organ part during the verses where the vocals would be. According to the liner notes of *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)* “Real’s Not Real” was recorded at TFS Studios in May of 2018 by Gareth Liddiard, with additional overdubs in Melbourne from July to November recorded by Stu. Footage of the band recording the song was featured in *[How to gut a Fishie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWLhIZpJUAs&t=691s)* with the audio being swapped for the final studio version. Stu (electric guitar/keyboards/vocals/Mellotron/bass/piano), Cavs (drums), Eric (drums), Ambrose (harmonica/vocals/tambourine/piano) and Joey (bass) played on “Real’s Not Real,” with the track being mixed by Sam Joseph. It would be released on *Fishing For Fishies* on April 26th, 2019.

“Real’s Not Real” has only been played a handful of times. The earliest known performance was on [2019-07-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-12-2019-thebarton-theatre-adelaide-sa-australia.html) at the Thebarton Theatre in Adelaide. Following this it made an appearance on [2019-08-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-25-2019-rebel-toronto-canada.html) before being played one final time on [2019-08-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-27-2019-college-street-music-hall-new-haven-ct-usa.html) at the College Street Music Hall in New Haven. While it has not been played since, Stu has [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k76l7nf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that he’s interested in bringing it back one day.
This Thing
“This Thing” is the only Joey-led song on *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)* and seems to focus on a fraught relationship. Despite the rift, however, Joey knows that one of them has to try and fix it — which he explains by describing the friendship as something waterlogged and in need of wringing out. While it might just be about a broken friendship, it could also be referring to our relationship to the environment, adding to the album’s overarching themes. The song starts with a simple and steady groove accented by distorted harmonica, harp and synthesized strings, that leads to a faster outro with layered repeating vocals, looping acoustics and synthesizer additions.


The liner notes state that “This Thing” was recorded at TFS Studios in May of 2018 by Gareth Liddiard, with additional overdubs recorded by Cook, Joey and Stu in Melbourne from July to November. The track was played by Cavs (drums/shaker/tambourine/conga), Joey (electric guitar/vocals/keyboards/synthesizer/acoustic guitar), Stu (bass/Mellotron/piano/vibraphone), Ambrose (harmonica) and Cook (electric guitar) and was mixed by Joey and Sam Joseph. It was released on *Fishing For Fishies* on April 26th, 2019.

Acarine
The Acarapis woodi is a microscopic parasite that specifically targets honey bees. These mites [enter the bee](https://www.vita-europe.com/beehealth/diseases/tracheal-mites-acarine/) through a small opening called the first thoracic spiracle and lay eggs inside. After maturing and mating inside of the bee, the females leave and hang on the body hair to get in contact with other uninfected potential hosts. The infestation of Acarapis woodi is known as acarine. Of course, this disease is [harmful if not deadly](http://beespoke.info/2014/02/25/acarine/) to the infected. *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)* is about environmental destruction ranging from nature’s interactions with the industrialized world ([“The Bird Song”](https://kglw.net/song/the-bird-song?artist_id=1)) to our use of plastic ([“Plastic Boogie”](https://kglw.net/song/plastic-boogie?artist_id=1)). However, “Acarine” looks just at the natural world, focusing on the parasite and bringing to mind the decline of honey bee populations and its massive ramifications for humanity. The song consists of an instantly recognizable 5/4 riff, a strange modulation bridge, and an outro that would fit in at a dark night club. It’s the first track on *Fishing For Fishies* to dive into the band’s electronic influence, especially techno. This style would grow more popular in the band with further explorations on other albums, like *[Made In Timeland](https://kglw.net/discography/made-in-timeland)* and *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*. It even has a callback to the *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* track [“Wah Wah”](https://kglw.net/song/wah-wah?artist_id=1) during its intro. While it’s a b-side that hasn’t been played since late 2019, “Acarine” has proven itself to be an influential piece of the Gizzverse, opening the door for a lot of experimentation going forward.

“Acarine” was originally a blues/rock/boogie jam that became an electronic track to fit with the darker tones the band ran into while making *Fishing For Fishies*. In an [interview with RockZone](https://issuu.com/rockzonemag/docs/rz_158), Stu said “originally [“Cyboogie”](https://kglw.net/song/cyboogie?artist_id=1) came from a guitar jam. We added a couple of fun jazz changes and threw some riffs on top. We recorded a couple of takes until we decided to remove the guitars and re-record everything using synthesizers. The first versions did fit in with the rest of the album, and the same thing happened with “Acarine”. The harmonica was reminiscent of some of the melodies of the other songs, but it was becoming increasingly darker, so we decided to dispense with the guitars and add the synths.” In Gizzard’s [2019 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3cdpl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Stu said that the first half of the song was written, recorded and mixed first but felt like it needed a place to lead to. The second half of the song was the answer to that issue. According to the liner notes for *Fishing For Fishies*, “Acarine” was primarily recorded in Guadalajara and Mexico City while on tour in October of 2018. This is corroborated by the end of *[KING GIZZ vs KEMONITO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw0yFGmB-AE&t=518s)*, where we see Ambrose recording the harmonica part heard in between the first chorus and second verse of the song in a hotel. While the song was built in Mexico, some drum parts had been recorded at TFS Studios that May and additional overdubs were done in Melbourne from July to November. Only Ambrose (harmonica/vocals), Cavs (drums), Joey (synthesizer) and Stu (drums/shaker/tambourine/bongo/synthesizer/piano/vocals/electric guitar/flute/Mellotron) would play on the track with Stu doing most of the work on a total of ten instruments. The song was mixed by Sam Joseph and Joey.

On February 1st, 2019, the band released the [7” single](https://www.discogs.com/release/13145574-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Cyboogie-Acarine) for “Cyboogie.” The b-side of the release was “Acarine,” making this the first time the song was heard by the public. The release party (with a clip of the song) can be seen in the documentary *[RATTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AzPaId5Qc&t=262s)*. It would be released on *Fishing For Fishies* on April 26th, 2019.

Initially the band didn’t know how they were going to perform the song live. In an [2019 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3b1ui/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) done in April, Stu wrote that they hadn’t rehearsed it at all. It made a live debut on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne) and was paired with [“Murder of the Universe”](https://kglw.net/song/murder-of-the-universe?artist_id=1) — a combination that became common. There are shows where these two were split, such as [2019-07-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-4-2019-the-tivoli-brisbane-qld-australia.html) at The Tivoli in Brisbane and [2019-10-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-6-2019-tivolivredenburg-ronda-utrecht-netherlands.html) at the TivoliVredenburg Ronda in Utrecht, but these were exceptions to the rule. It had a decent amount of performances throughout the year, but has not been played since [2019-10-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-11-2019-carlswerk-victoria-cologne-germany.html) in Carlswerk Victoria in Cologne. Live versions do not feature the song’s synth outro.
Cyboogie
King Gizzard is one of the most prolific bands of our time. It’s hard to name any band right now who is constantly working the way they do. While other bands in the history of music have done multiple albums a year, how many have done five albums a year twice? For fans this is a true blessing, but for the band it can be an exhaustive, tiring journey. After releasing five full length studio albums in 2017, they took a break with no new music at all in 2018. Only in retrospect do we know that they were recording *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)* during this time. The drought of new material finally ended in early 2019 when the band released their first new song since New Year’s Eve 2017: a synth-boogie simply titled “Cyboogie.” Bouncy, catchy, and dark, with similarities to [The Rockets version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxLMyG_2qJk) of [“On The Road Again,”](https://kglw.net/song/on-the-road-again), the song details a depressed cyborg who has lost their humanity and resents their unnatural, mechanical life. In line with this, the song sees the return of Han-Tyumi, a cyborg first heard on *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* who recites a reversed and pitched down passage at the end of the song.. He reduces the trajectory of human evolution over two hundred thousand years down to our ability to dance, foreshadowing that it will carry us towards our extinction. With arpeggiated synthesizers, prominent vocoder use and earworms for days, the track became a nearly instant fan favorite and opened the door for the band’s return to new material in 2019, as well as new iconography that has followed the band since.

*Fishing For Fishies* was originally created as their blues record, although this idea didn’t pan out as it was supposed to. Despite being fully electronic in its final form, “Cyboogie” was originally a jazzy/bluesy guitar track. In an [interview with RockZone](https://issuu.com/rockzonemag/docs/rz_158), Stu said “originally “Cyboogie” came from a guitar jam. We added a couple of fun jazz changes and threw some riffs on top. We recorded a couple of takes until we decided to remove the guitars and re-record everything using synthesizers. The first versions did fit in with the rest of the album, and the same thing happened with [“Acarine”](https://kglw.net/song/acarine?artist_id=1). The harmonica was reminiscent of some of the melodies of the other songs, but it was becoming increasingly darker, so we decided to dispense with the guitars and add the synths.” When asked if this version of the song would ever be released in their [2019 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3eh9s/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Stu said he had no intention of it — although this was prior to the numerous demos albums. Liner notes indicate that a majority of the song was done at Flightless HQ in January 2018, with additional drums in May at TFS Studios and overdubs at the end of the year in Melbourne. Recording sessions for both locations (with a murky demo version) can be seen/heard in *[How to gut a Fishie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWLhIZpJUAs)*. In the end Cavs (drums), Joey (synthesizer), Cook (synthesizer), Lucas (synthesizer), Ambrose (keyboards) and Stu (vocals/vocoder/keyboards/synthesizers) played on the track, with Han-Tyumi getting a vocal credit in the liner notes. The song was mixed by Sam Joseph.

On January 27th, 2019, the band [teased](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1089674710533603328?s=20) a new video with an image showing four stills of Stu. A few days later on the 31st, Jason Galea’s [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_un9PYsE1_g) for “Cyboogie” was released. This made “Cyboogie” not just the first new music video from the band since “Crumbling Castle,” but the first new song since the release of *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)* in late 2017. The video shows Stu disembodied with only his head and hands visible. He is wearing a black helmet with a microphone dangling down, pointed at his face. The rest of the band are seen in red shirts and pants with white helmets playing other modular synthesizers. On the screen of each synth is a scrolling loop of the fishie face. The video consists of the band playing the song with Joey at the end, now wearing a yellow outfit, reciting Han-Tyumi’s backwards message. Footage of the band during the filming of the video made it into *How to gut a Fishie*. A poster of the band on set was included with [vinyl copies](https://www.discogs.com/release/13509733-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Fishing-For-Fishies) of *Fishing For Fishies.* After the video’s release, the props went their separate ways. On February 12th, a number of the modular synthesizers were put out on the sidewalk. A [photo of Eric sitting on top of them](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/RTRCzfP9pNUtZTi6/) was posted to Flightless’ Instagram story with the caption “come own a piece of J.Galea memorabilia.” In the following years those who took the props would [post photos](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/rZo7Av4698ehLyiB/) of theirs online, giving a better look at the pieces. It doesn’t seem like the band got rid of all of them however as another [Flightless Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/b04l50/yall_see_this_on_the_flightless_insta_story_they/) from March 12th shows that one of the synths was being used by the band to play Nintendo 64 games (specifically *[Mario Kart 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart_64)*, though other games can be seen on top of the cabinet). Beyond the synths, Stu’s helmet was put inside of the counter at the Flightless 168 store with the white helmets worn by the rest of the band placed atop the back wall. [Later in the store’s lifetime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=17RDxOHA5sI), Stu’s helmet joined the rest. The music video would be referenced throughout 2019 on the band’s tour posters, making its way onto posters for [2019-07-03](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-3-2019-the-tivoli-brisbane-qld-australia.html), [2019-07-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-5-2019-unsw-roundhouse-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html), [2019-08-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-17-2019-harbour-event-convention-centre-vancouver-canada.html) and [2019-08-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-20-2019-the-depot-salt-lake-city-ut-usa.html). That same year a [print](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/eurqe0/one_of_my_most_meaningful_possessions/) of Stu from the video was sold by Sublation. The same night of the music video’s debut, Gizzard released a [7” single](https://www.discogs.com/release/13145574-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Cyboogie-Acarine) of the song with the b-side of “Acarine.” To celebrate its release, the band [hosted an event](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/alkjwa/cyboogie_7_release_details/) at Flightless HQ where they sold the single for $10 AUD. Footage of the release party can be seen in the documentary *[RATTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AzPaId5Qc&t=262s)*. The song would be released as the final song of *Fishing For Fishies* on April 26th, 2019. A synth pattern from the song was later used as the basis for the *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)* song [“Evilest Man.”](https://kglw.net/song/evilest-man?artist_id=1)

Initially the band didn’t know how they were going to perform the song live. In a [2019 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3b1ui/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu wrote that they hadn’t rehearsed it at all. That said, it made its live debut on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne). Throughout 2019 the song would be in heavy rotation and it even made a quick appearance in the documentary *RATTY*. These renditions are much less synth-based than the studio version, with extensive use of a distorted wah-like guitar from Joey, and a different vocoder used by Stu. It was usually played as a standalone song, although it did appear in short jams for a bit, such as on [2019-09-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-1-2019-new-belgium-brewing-company-asheville-nc-usa.html) where it ends on a strange key to lead into “Loyalty.” It saw two performances in 2020 before disappearing after a gig on [2020-02-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-21-2020-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) before the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the song has not been, which is surprising given the band’s expanding synth setup. Stu [brought up](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1470317337991475200?s=20) the idea of an acoustic “Cyboogie” in December of 2021, but this never materialized. He [also](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1470317811868520452?s=20) (seemingly in jest) responded to a request for a reggae album with the sentence: “Reggae cyboogie.” 
Infest the Rats’ Nest
Planet B
“There is no planet B.” A simple but powerful phrase. While it’s unclear where it originated, it has been a common slogan for environmentalists across the world since long before joining the Gizzverse canon. As Earth warms and thresholds are broken, the consequences will be, and already are, deadly. Ocean levels are rising to displace those living near the coasts, our ability to grow crops is getting more and more restricted, trillions of gallons of water have evaporated from rivers and basins, and the increasing heat continues to take the lives of more and more people. Meanwhile, factories pump out CO2 like it’s nothing, hunters and farmers kill animals for food and sport and we build cities and developments over forests, deserts and plains. Earth as a planet is extraordinarily unique — the only known planet in the universe to host any life, yet one we gradually destroy out of greed and desire. One might argue that there are other places humanity could go. Perhaps an exoplanet like [Kepler-22b](https://kglw.net/song/kepler-22b?artist_id=1) is capable of hosting life, or maybe Mars? However, even these have major caveats that make it hard to say they’re viable options; even if humanity can survive off Earth, would it be worth it knowing what we gave up? The truth is we’re all alone. This is our home. There is no planet B. This idea of mass suffering and environmental instability here on Earth is the foundation for the first song from *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)*, simply titled “Planet B.”

“Planet B” was a real turning point for King Gizzard. Metal had been [a part of the lives of Stu, Joey and Cavs](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/the-10-best-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-songs-so-far), and while they dabbled in some metal tendencies on *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* and *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup), it was this song that provided the idea to go further. In a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6u7kx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu wrote “I didn't think we would ever make a thrash album until we wrote ‘Planet B.’ It was a light bulb moment and ended up inspiring the whole record.” A barebones demo for the song (released on *[Demos Vol. 1: Music To Kill Bad People To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-1)*) features a drum machine and some distorted guitars at a slower pace. The form is mostly there, barring the bridge, but the song features different lyrics that are obscured by the instrumental. Notably, it ends with a unique phrase that doesn’t make it to the studio version, “there is one Planet B” — perhaps alluding to Mars’ role within the story of *Infest the Rats’ Nest*. The creation of the song in the studio is detailed in the documentary *[RATTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AzPaId5Qc)* which shows the band struggling to get the song down, with Joey stating “this song’s fucked” and Stu remarking on how the song makes him feel tense. The final song was performed by only Stu (vocals/guitar), Joey (bass) and Cavs (drums).

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtTi_uyYynA) would be released on April 8th, 2019, with [a single](https://open.spotify.com/album/3S53pDv8ilahghV8Rc00iP) releasing on the 14th. The first directed by John Angus Stewart, it starts with bold red words on a black background spelling the band name and song title while the band is heard barking like dogs. It then cuts to them on an old airfield in orange shirts and pants with white sneakers, eerily smiling and dancing around during the middle of the day. About halfway through, during the song’s break, a white Mitsubishi Lancer pulls up and out comes a bald woman referred to as Zagan (played by Katherine Grinlaw). Aiming a shotgun, she shoots Cook, splattering blood onto Stu’s face. As the band runs away, she then shoots Eric, Cavs and Joey. Ambrose voluntarily lies on the ground and is shot dead, with Lucas pretending to play jump rope before meeting the same fate. At dusk Stu sits in the middle of the tarmac, arms outstretched, and is shot. At night, illuminated by the headlights of the Lancer, the band’s bodies are put into a pile where Zagan douses them in gasoline, lights a match and throws it at them. The video was released at the same time the band was promoting their album *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)*. In fact [the video for that album’s title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beIDKFwXam0) was released only a month prior. The contrast couldn’t be stronger. In a [Flightless newsletter](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/bdcds0/the_latest_flightless_newsletter_gives_the_plot/) the video’s plot was described like so: “Standing in the final moments of civilization, the offerers repent. Through their rituals they summon Zagan, a president of Hell. Zagan, wearing the meat suit of a woman grants them a safe passage into the vestibule of hell. Using a Mitsubishi Lancer and a sawn off shotgun she performs her last rights opening the gateway to hedies.” Later in an [interview with KEXP’s Cheryl Waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnmFKS2eDBA&t=79s), Stu said that the theme throughout the videos for *Infest* were based on humanity’s uncaring attitude towards the natural world. “The interesting thing about humans is that we are kind of going down laughing at the moment, and we’re having a good time as we go down, and I think that was the main, general theme for all of the videos.” He would share a similar sentiment in the [previously mentioned Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3f8sx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The video would be referenced on the posters for their shows on [2019-07-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-5-2019-unsw-roundhouse-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html) and [2019-08-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-24-2019-aragon-ballroom-chicago-il-usa.html). 


Two versions of the song have been released. The [single version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEBuGqaFboE) features two drum parts played over each other to create a heavier rhythm section. The [final version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGzkVWX5Ufs), released on August 16th, has only one drum part with an added higher-pitched guitar part before the verses.

“Planet B” was debuted live on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) during a surprise show at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne). Since then, the track has been in regular rotation. Deviating little from the studio version, the song’s only notable change has been a longer drum break before the bridge. A rendition of the song from [2019-06-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-28-2019-forum-theatre-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) would appear in the video *[Live at the Forum Melbourne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1QK9ZHIKQw&t=118s)*, where it was originally mis-labeled as having taken place in April. This was a test run for their concert film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*, where the song would also appear this time using a performance from [2019-10-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-5-2019-alexandra-palace-london-england.html). Lucas [noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnr34uj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that it was one of the most taxing songs he ever had to learn due to its speed picking.

Mars For The Rich
The idea to colonize space is nothing new and for as long as this idea has existed, Mars has been one of the planets of choice. Not only is it relatively close to Earth, the surface conditions of the planet are much more hospitable than most. While humans would have to live in enclosed settlements due to the dangerous environment, and would have to deal with a number of threats such as radiation and dust storms, Mars is a dream for many futurists and billionaires. The wealthiest man in the world, Elon Musk, is one of the biggest advocates for a Mars colony, although his plans reveal a bit more than a new age of humanity as it’s impossible to separate the issues of class struggle from his vision. While the majority of all people on Earth will never escape poverty even after a lifetime of work, Musk (and others like Jeff Bezos) are only able to scheme at leaving the planet by hoarding unfathomable amounts of wealth and resources. Putting aside how Musk’s planned Mars colony is [continuously pushed back](https://www.wsj.com/video/elon-musk-ill-put-a-man-on-mars-in-10-years/CCF1FC62-BB0D-4561-938C-DF0DEFAD15BA), a hypothetical Musk Mars is worth some scrutiny. In the scenario where a rocket to the red planet is feasible, the price to leave Earth would be inaccessibly expensive. King Gizzard’s view of what a Mars colony would be is far from the sci-fi wonder presented by someone like Musk. While the poor suffer on Earth, working in crop fields and enduring climate change, they must watch the rich flee to Mars to live extravagant lives instead of addressing the inequality and global warming that degraded the planet in the first place. The one way ticket is so expensive that there is no choice. There is no Planet B, unless you’re a millionaire.

Two demos for the track have been released. The first (shown on the band’s [unannounced demos live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ge8A4pC6mE&t=295s) and later released on *[Demos Vol. 1: Music To Kill Bad People To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-1)*), is an instrumental jam that doesn’t feature *[Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)*’s thrash tendencies. Starting with bass and delay guitars, the song features a different key, a completely different form, a synth solo and a motorik beat towards the end. The second demo (released on *[Demos Vol. 3: Music to Eat Pond Scum To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-3)*) is much closer to the final version but still has a few differences. After the main riff is the chorus proper rather than an instrumental chorus. The second verse is just a repeat of the first while the second has lyrics resembling “red Mars, because, sing us, red Mars for the rich.” The freak out after the second chorus is missing and instead leads to the bass solo, which itself is more frantic than the final version. The final chorus goes “red Mars, because, live large, red Mars for the Rich.”  The final studio version was played by Stu (vocals/guitar), Joey (bass), Cavs (drums), Cook (guitar) and Ambrose (harmonica).

On August 13th, 2019, a Unity game titled *[MARS FOR THE RICH](http://www.marsfortherich.com)* (later referred to as *Rat Game* on the [band’s website](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/)) was launched to promote *Infest the Rats’ Nest*. Developed by [nuevodisco.systems](https://www.instagram.com/nuevodisco.systems/), *MARS FOR THE RICH* is a low-poly 3D first person shooter inspired by games like *[Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game))*, even taking sound effects from it. After the lighting of the rat skull altar seen on the cover of *Infest the Rats’ Nest*, you must kill a horde of rats while grabbing health in the form of fruits, as well as bullets to survive as long as possible. While defending yourself from the enemies, “Mars For The Rich” plays. The game also features an unnamed chiptune composition on the title screen. While the game is mostly promotion for *Infest the Rats’ Nest*, it features an easter egg for the debut Bullant album *[Tyson, Crying](https://www.discogs.com/release/14728976-Bullant-Tyson-Crying)*, containing the song “VIEWBANK” and a distorted version of the album cover. The same day of the game’s release, Jason Galea, Stu and Cavs played the game on an [Instagram livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D16yevF_g6A) while on tour (they played a [gig at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles]https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-13-2019-greek-theatre-los-angeles-ca-usa.html) that very day). After the 13th and the discovery of the Bullant easter egg, a small community of speedrunners on YouTube decided to give the game a shot, creating the “Tyson%” run to see who can get to the secret in the shortest amount of time. As of writing, the current world record is held by Abstraxt who holds a [46.99 run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCpXvl98ikM), uploaded to YouTube on August 29th, 2019. *MARS FOR THE RICH* would later be referenced on Jason Galea’s poster for King Gizzard’s show at the TivoliVredenburg on [2019-10-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-6-2019-tivolivredenburg-ronda-utrecht-netherlands.html).

The song debuted on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) during a surprise show at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne) and joined the band’s regular rotation that year like many other *Infest* songs. It has remained a prominent song since, never deviating far from the studio version. A performance from [2019-10-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-1-2019-barrowland-glasgow-scotland.html) was released as a bonus feature for the tour film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. During the [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnr5w0i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for the movie, Cavs mentioned that it is one of his favorites to play live.

Organ Farmer
With a fast, chaotic pace and some of the goriest lyrics in the Gizzard canon, “Organ Farmer” is as intense and raw as *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)* gets. The song studies a “human laboratory,” where people are genetically grown/modified and then butchered for their organs, which are then sold by the government. It's brutal, but also speaks to something larger including the perspective of the farmer themselves admitting a conflict over their actions. On one hand they’re doing what they can to survive, this is their job and in desperate times they need some sense of security. However, on the other hand the exploitation and butchery is so disgusting and inhumane that they feel it may be better to die than to continue. While the song focuses on this one job in particular, Stu recounts a number of ways through which humanity bends nature to its will, drawing a comparison between the cruelty of the organ farming industry to industrial fishing and deforestation from the lumber industry. The lyrics also draw many comparisons to factory farming which adds another layer of realism to the piece. 


The song was performed by Stu (vocals/guitar), Joey (bass/backing vocals) and Cavs (drums), and was described in a Flightless newsletter as: “Ferocious and direct, ‘Organ Farmer’ is built on drums that gallop away like a battalion of wild horses over the horizon and a triple guitar attack set to stun. It’s the type of sub-three minute song you wish Hetfield and co. still made.”

In the middle of June, King Gizzard began to take applications for an unspecified event. A [message was sent to the winners](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/c19hli/any_other_melburnian_fans_win_the_insta_contest/) which detailed what was in store. The event would take place on June 19th, 2019 with specific instructions for attendees. “THIS IS NOT A GIG. NOTHING WILL BE FOR SALE. THIS IS THE DEATH KNELL. THE FINAL BLOW. YOUR FACE HAS NO PLACE HERE. COVER IT.” The entire memo reads like a cult manifesto with mentions of how they will “descend” and mentions that alcohol and drugs “no longer matter.” This turned out to be the video shoot for “Organ Farmer,” and before it had even been released, some vital info was making the rounds online. [According to a Reddit user who attended](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/c5g7pr/comment/es1whrf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) “at the video shoot they told us it was about a ritualistic mass suicide for people who want to leave this planet, and are eager to get to their destination in the next life, because it will be far better than what Earth has become. The destination is Hell.” Regarding the masks, [another attendee said](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/c2gh5u/comment/erlvnoj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) “I think it was just to help us get in the mood, the only people not wearing masks were Gizz themselves and Catherine (I think that was her name). At one point it was explained that the masks were there because we represented ‘the people’ rather than individuals in the story of the video, but I'm guessing it also helped that no one had to sign any release forms for that reason.” [Another commenter wrote of the experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/c2go30/comment/erlcamb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) “they played the song at the start (it was fuckin amazing!) and then played some tunes for us to dance too while filming some clips to get us in the mood.” According to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/c2go30/comment/erl5k4q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), one of the songs was [“I Was Made For Lovin’ You”](https://kglw.net/song/i-was-made-for-lovin-you) by Kiss. Days later on the 25th, a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qskg6yvn8vc) for the song by John Angus Stewart would be released alongside [a single for the track](https://www.discogs.com/release/16150051-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Organ-Farmer). Starting with bold pink text reading “ORGAN FARMER,” it cuts to the band shirtless with the song’s title written over their bodies. Zagan (from the other *Rats’ Nest* videos, played by Katherine Grinlaw) appears in a bright green jacket (studded with teddy bears) and equipped with a fire extinguisher-like device. The band then destroys the Mitsubishi Lancer seen in the previous videos while singing the song. Half way through it cuts back to Zagan, now holding a flare with a crowd of masked people behind her who swarm the band. As they jump around and dance, Zagan appears at the top of a staircase and uses the strapped-on device to release white smoke onto the crowd. The video would later be referenced on the poster for [2019-08-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-24-2019-aragon-ballroom-chicago-il-usa.html) with a [signed photo of the band on set](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7aB82qhatw/?img_index=8) being auctioned off in early 2020. A [limited print of the video shoot](https://phcfilms.com/store) was sold by PHC Films in late 2020. For the [“Smouldering Rodent Carcass”](https://www.discogs.com/release/26821439-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Infest-The-Rats-Nest) editions of *Infest the Rats’ Nest* released in March of 2023, a poster of the band from the “Organ Farmer” video shoot was included. A number of [photos from the shoot](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSHPxR4JB7H/?img_index=1) were uploaded by Jason Galea in the summer of 2021.

The song made a live debut during a surprise show on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne) alongside many other *Rats’ Nest* tracks, a day after the single dropped. Throughout 2019 “Organ Farmer” would be played regularly. An early performance from [2019-06-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-28-2019-forum-theatre-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) would be featured (albeit incomplete) in *[Live at the Forum Theatre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1QK9ZHIKQw&t=118s)*. Other footage of the song from the year appeared in the documentary *[RATTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AzPaId5Qc&t=914s)*. The song would make a handful of appearances in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic and disappear throughout all of 2021 before coming back on [2022-04-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-19-2022-marquee-theatre-tempe-az-usa.html) after a twenty-five show gap. The rate of appearances slowed down that year and only slowed more in 2023. While still in rotation, “Organ Farmer” isn’t as common as it once was.

Superbug
While the first side of *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)* mainly centers on how humanity is capable of destroying everything around them to catastrophic and existential results, “Superbug” shows another thing that can lead to the end of human life. The lyrics detail a virus so deadly and resistant to antibiotics that it is virtually unstoppable, a result of governments and doctors waiting to deal with it rather than tackling it as soon as it appeared. The concept of the song is a very real threat. Using various different antibiotics decade upon decade, even when they weren’t fit for the purpose (for example viral diseases), forces pathogens to evolve to become more and more resilient, to the point where antibiotics are no longer able to stop them. These are superbugs. In the past decade [antibiotic resistance has become a fast growing problem](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4378521/), with some organizations such as the CDC arguing we’re in a “post-antibiotic” world. This poses serious risks to the health of humanity with potential to cause a global pandemic. In a Flightless newsletter, they wrote “‘Superbug’ sings of the type of lurgy that will one day destroy us all…” The song turned out to be a bit prophetic, as in the following year the COVID-19 pandemic began, demonstrating the possible future in store if we don’t fight these diseases as they appear (the band even said on [2022-04-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-26-2022-gundlach-bundschu-winery-sonoma-ca-usa.html) that it’s a “song we wrote in 2019 about 2020.”) Though not technically a superbug, [the CDC has said](https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/covid19.html) that the COVID-19 pandemic has made fighting antibiotic resistance more difficult, and that “the threat of antimicrobial-resistant infections is not only still present but has gotten worse.” Paired with [scientists warning](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/what-we-do/2021-highlights/climate-change.html) of how diseases will be easier transmitted due to global warming, the COVID-19 lockdown may not be the only event “Superbug” warns of. It was performed by Stu (vocals/guitar), Joey (bass), Cavs (drums), Ambrose (backing vocals) and Cook (guitar).

Out of all of the *Infest the Rats’ Nest* songs, “Superbug” is by far the least common. While the rest of *Infest the Rats’ Nest* made their live debuts on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), “Superbug” would appear a month later on [2019-07-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-28-2019-club-sharp-seoul-south-korea.html) at Club S.H.A.R.P. in Seoul during a full performance of the album. It would be played a handful of times more with a final performance before the COVID-19 lockdown on [2020-01-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-january-27-2020-albert-park-auckland-aotearoa-new-zealand.html). After two years, “Superbug” returned on [2022-04-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-26-2022-gundlach-bundschu-winery-sonoma-ca-usa.html) at the Gundlach-Bundschu Winery in Sonoma with a few more performances throughout the year. 2023 saw even less instances, lulling us all into a false sense of security.

Venusian 1
Described as “a shredding collection featuring an army of guitars” in a Flightless newsletter, “Venusian 1” opens the second side of *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)* with a bang. In an [interview with New Noise Magazine](https://newnoisemagazine.com/interviews/interview-king-gizzard-lizard-wizard/), Stu said “It’s kind of about a handful of rogue earthlings, I guess you would call them, who are trying to escape from this planet that is dying — or this planet that is being killed, I suppose — and they can’t go to Mars, because they don’t have enough money to get in, so they go rogue and build a spaceship and send it to Venus and try to colonize and they’re not very successful there either.”  
“Venusian 1” is the first part of a three-song suite which builds on the album’s first side. As Earth becomes more and more uninhabitable, a group of humans realize that the only way to live on is to travel into space. They set off towards the second planet from the sun, Venus, on two spaceships of junk called the Venusian 1 and [Venusian 2](https://kglw.net/song/venusian-2?artist_id=1). There may not be a [Planet B](https://kglw.net/song/planet-b?artist_id=1), but there is a Planet V.

Early versions of “Venusian 1” can be heard in the documentary *[RATTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AzPaId5Qc&t=1154s)*. The band discusses if they should add a gap to the song and rehearse the track to get the structure down. The song features the main group of Stu (vocals/guitar), Joey (bass) and Cavs (drums), as well as Ambrose and Cook who provide backing vocals and guitar. “Venusian 1” was released as part of *Infest the Rats’ Nest* on August 16th, 2019.

The song made a live debut during a surprise show on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne) and was played heavily throughout the year into 2020. In 2021 the song would disappear from sets and then reemerge on [2022-05-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-24-2022-water-street-music-hall-rochester-ny-usa.html) at the Water Street Music Hall, marking a brief return to their shows. In 2023 the song was played only once at Progresja on [2023-03-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-11-2023-progresja-warsaw-poland.html). While the song is part of a three-song suite on *Infest the Rats’ Nest* and is often paired with [“Perihelion”](https://kglw.net/song/perihelion?artist_id=1) or “Venusian 2,” the song has also appeared as a standalone track at numerous shows. During the *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel) [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnr5w0i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Cavs mentioned that this is one of his favorites to play.

Perihelion
Following the story set up in [“Venusian 1,”](https://kglw.net/song/venusian-1?artist_id=1) the ‘rogue Earthlings’ try to use the sun’s gravity to propel themselves to Venus, so they launch themselves into orbit. Unfortunately for the Venusian 1, during the ship’s perihelion a solar flare emerges. The rocket flies towards the burst of electromagnetic energy, melting the crew as they yell their final words. Of course the song is inspired by actual astronomical terms; the perihelion is defined as when a body in orbit is closest to the sun. Orbits are not completely circular, [in fact they’re often highly elliptic](https://www.space.com/what-is-perihelion). Taking Earth as an example, the sun doesn’t sit at the center of its orbit, meaning there are times where we are closer than usual and vice versa (this is an aphelion). The Greek word is a combination of peri (meaning “near”) and helios (the embodiment of the Sun). Then there’s the “solar mountain” which eats the crew, referring to solar flares. [When electromagnetic radiation grows and tangles within the sun’s corona](https://www.space.com/solar-flares-effects-classification-formation) (outer atmosphere), it reaches a bursting point where that energy is then shot out into space. These flares are so powerful that they can even create [radio blackouts](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/phenomena/solar-flares-radio-blackouts) here on Earth due to the radiation affecting the ionosphere, as well as [auroras](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/nmp/st5/SCIENCE/aurora.html).“Perihelion” is both a gruesome tale of space colonization and a song that puts into words the monumental size and power of the sun.

A jam session with the song can be found in the documentary *[RATTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AzPaId5Qc)* alongside an early instrumental recording. Stu mentions that he could change the bass part but that, for the most part, they’re happy with the results. The song features the main group of Stu (vocals/bass/guitar), Joey (guitar/backing vocals) and Cavs (drums), as well as Ambrose and Cookie who provide backing vocals, harmonica and guitar. It was released as part of *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)* on August 16th, 2019. In 2022 the song’s four-chord riff was quoted at the end of the solo on [“Predator X.”](https://kglw.net/song/predator-x?artist_id=1)

A soundcheck of the song from the 2019 European tour would appear in the film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. In 2020 it was played a few times before the COVID-19 pandemic but stayed with the band in 2021 going into 2022; where it would be played regularly. By 2023 it was appearing much less. Live performances of the song do not deviate from the album version.

Venusian 2
After the destruction of [Venusian 1](https://kglw.net/song/venusian-1?artist_id=1) in a solar flare, another crew of humans in a separate spaceship called the Venusian 2 grit their teeth and pull through towards Venus. Miraculously, they are able to make it through the planet’s atmosphere and land on the surface. They have made it to Planet V.  
“Venusian 2” is the triumphant third song in a three-song suite opening the second side of *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)* featuring Lemmy-esque vocals, a pounding drum part, and a load of chugging guitars.

A demo of the song was released on *[Demos Vol. 5: Music To Think Existentially To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-5-music-to-think-existentially-to)*. This version features two vocal parts, both singing different, seemingly improvised lyrics. The song’s form is also incomplete. The pre-chorus is twice as long as the final version, there’s an instrumental break before the chorus, there’s no bass solo and the outro is different, with Stu singing a layered “call and response” part similar to what would appear on the final version. The song features the main team of Stu (vocals/guitar), Joey (bass/backing vocals) and Cavs (drums/backing vocals), but also Ambrose and Cook doing backing vocals. “Venusian 2” was released as part of *Infest the Rats’ Nest* on August 16th, 2019.

“Venusian 2” debuted live on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) during a surprise show at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne) and was played heavily throughout 2019 with a performance from [2019-10-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-15-2019-alcatraz-milan-italy.html) making it into the concert film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. Another live performance would be briefly heard in the documentary *[RATTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AzPaId5Qc&t=1154s)*. It was often played towards the beginning of sets before fall, when it would shift towards the middle or end of sets. While it could be paired with “Venusian 1” or [“Perihelion,”](https://kglw.net/song/perihelion?artist_id=1) as in the album, the song was usually played on its own. It was played a few times before the pandemic in 2020 and then once in 2021 during the “Play On Victoria” festival on [2021-10-30](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-30-2021-sidney-myer-music-bowl-naarm-melbourne-australia.html). “Venusian 2” was in heavy rotation for 2022 and made a few appearances in the following year, making it the “Venusian” track with the highest number of plays. A similar drum beat would be played in the video *[Cavs’ Rig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlUoYCkW_9g)*.

Self-Immolate
“Self-Immolate” opens with a pattern reminiscent of Orc war drums, one of the most ominous and iconic intros of any King Gizzard song. It sets the off-kilter rhythm for a chugging guitar riff that drives one of their evilest songs. A Flightless newsletter reads: “‘Self-Immolate’ sees riff piled upon riff and Stu Mackenzie delivering a vocal display to stand alongside the likes of Tom Araya or Max Cavalera.” One of the most beloved metal songs in their discography, it describes the final moments of a doomed space trip away from Earth. Following the story of the travelers  in “Venusian 2,” they land on Venus and step out only to be lit ablaze. [According to NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/resource/solar-system-temperatures/), the surface of Venus is eight hundred and sixty-four degrees Fahrenheit (four hundred and sixty-four degrees Celsius) due to its atmosphere, making it the hottest planet in our solar system. This leaves the crew of Venusian 2 to die stranded, though their fate is welcomed. They were sick of being stuck in a ship and tired of life on Earth. At this point, death and a one way trip to Hell is more welcoming. They happily sacrifice themselves to the planet through fire.

A demo for the song can be heard on *[Demos Vol. 6: Music To Burn Money To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-6-music-to-burn-money-to)*. Lacking the drum intro and most of the vocals and guitar lead parts of the final version, it’s a mostly instrumental version of the song that is otherwise close to the final version heard on *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)*. Early versions of “Self-Immolate” can be seen throughout the documentary *[RATTY](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-5-2019-alexandra-palace-london-england.html)*. At the beginning of the film, the band rehearses the song, debating the structure and figuring out the drum intro with Stu suggesting that it could be three hits, but Cavs cementing it as two. Stu also remarks that the song is “scary.” Later the band is seen going over a recorded, though possibly unmixed, version of the completed song. On April 29th, 2019, King Gizzard hosted a [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/king_gizzard_the_lizard_wizard_ama/) on r/indieheads. The account they used to answer questions was [u/Auto_Cremate](https://www.reddit.com/user/Auto_Cremate/), leading fans to speculate that “Auto Cremate” would be the title of an upcoming metal album. When asked if this was the title, they responded both [yes](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3cpeh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [no](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/biuz0b/comment/em3imhd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), leaving fans wondering. The final version of the song would feature Stu (vocals/guitar/bass), Joey (bass/backing vocals), Cavs (drums/backing vocals), Ambrose (backing vocals), Cook (backing vocals) and Eric (backing vocals). The song was briefly used in season two of the TV show *[The Purge](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/k99x02/was_watching_the_purge_show_when_no_spoilers/)*. The band would later reference the lyrics of “Self-Immolate” on the tracks [“The Hungry Wolf of Fate”](https://kglw.net/song/the-hungry-wolf-of-fate) and [“Magma.”](https://kglw.net/song/magma)

[The band teased](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1130956147740086276?s=20) a new video on May 21st, 2019. A [video for “Self-Immolate”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmAlQvDQGoI) directed by John Angus Stewart would drop on May 29th alongside a [single](https://www.discogs.com/release/14081784-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Self-Immolate). Following the events of [“Planet B,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtTi_uyYynA) it starts with flashing green text and Zagan (played by Katherine Grinlaw) driving up to the band, who are curled up on the tarmac wearing black and blue jackets. Zagan gets out with a can of gasoline and drinks from it, while each member of the band is shown spitting some out, implying they have been doused. Throwing away the can, Zagan lights a flare and the band runs aimlessly into the darkness, seemingly half awake and stumbling around. As Zagan spits out more gasoline while sitting in her car, the band follows. Suddenly the band is on fire while Zagan lights another flare on the roof of her car. As the band flails around in pain and confusion, Zagan sits alone and takes a look at the camera before a cut to black. In a [Flightless newsletter](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/bu6joi/the_plot_thickens_from_the_flightless_email/) John Angus Stewart described the plot. “The offerers were sent to hell. But what was only a few moments on earth, were over 500 years for the offerers. Zagan, summons them back to earth to keep her side of the bargain. The offerers are shadows of what they once were after lifetimes served in the spiralling, stinking pits of Hell. They have forgotten existence without constant agony, searing heat and torture. They quiver and shake, terrified of a place they once only knew but now cannot conceive. Zagan performs the ritual of reanimation, possessing them with a half-life. The offerers, vomit and choke as the petrol fills their lungs. To complete the re-animation ritual they must self-immolate to cauterise their new form. They turn to hell with a blind, idealistic, altruistic hope, but now they have become the anthropomorphised doom and fire that will consume the earth itself.” When [asked what the video was about](https://newnoisemagazine.com/interviews/interview-king-gizzard-lizard-wizard/), Stu responded by explaining all three videos released for *Rats’ Nest*: “The film clip for ‘Planet B’ and the film clip for ‘Self-Immolate,’ and we’re going to do another one as well, they all sort of tie into this theme that we, as a species, are killing ourselves, essentially. We’re digging our own graves, but we’re actually going down laughing, and it’s a disturbing combination. Generally, we are all like, ‘This is scary, the permafrost is melting,’ but we’re actually not scared. Everyone is kind of happy and going about living their lives. Maybe that’s embedded in our nature to be like that, but it’s kind of an interesting observation. I think that’s the kind of lynchpin behind all those videos.” 
A shot of the band on fire would be used for the [gatefold design on vinyl editions](https://www.discogs.com/release/14002915-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Infest-The-Rats-Nest/image/SW1hZ2U6NjU2NDg3NTI=) of the album. For the band’s show poster on [2019-08-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-24-2019-aragon-ballroom-chicago-il-usa.html), the video is referenced multiple times. A [print of Zagan in the Mitsubishi Lancer](https://phcfilms.com/store) was sold by PHC Films in late 2020.

“Self-Immolate” made its live debut on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) during a surprise show at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne) and would be played at most shows in 2019, taking a spot wherever needed, although it was a prominent opener. A performance from [2019-06-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-28-2019-forum-theatre-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) would be featured (albeit incomplete) in [Live at the Forum Melbourne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1QK9ZHIKQw&t=118s). For the film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* which documented the 2019 European tour, “Self-Immolate” would be used in a [teaser trailer](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1245819037734432769?s=20) uploaded on April 2nd, 2020. While a performance and soundcheck of the song from [2019-10-05(https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-5-2019-alexandra-palace-london-england.html)] would appear during the intro of the film, they were incomplete and never included on the film’s soundtrack. Before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, “Self-Immolate” was still played regularly, a trend which continued even after the lockdowns. While versions up to this point don’t stray far from the studio version outside of a potentially longer intro and some pipe organ additions from Ambrose, in 2022 the song was updated to include a longer drum solo from Cavs. This has been the go-to version for the band since. Outside of the band, the song would be played at [Cavs’ first drum seminar](https://youtu.be/M9O9b-U0nl4?si=f8iCscpGMaW8Wgl_) at Drumtek in Northcote, Victoria. Eric mentioned during the *Chunky Shrapnel* [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnr5nqb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that “Self-Immolate” took a while to learn and was hard to play live.

Hell
After their deaths on the surface of Venus, the crew of the [Venusian 2](https://kglw.net/song/venusian-2?artist_id=1) find themselves in the depths of Hell, where Satan himself gives them a proposition to enter the “rats’ nest.” In the end they take up the offer and fifteen soldiers “infest” the nest — entering a fiery afterlife. The number fifteen may not have been picked at random, as *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)* was the band’s fifteenth studio album. Stu would summarize both the song and the album as a whole in an [interview for New Noise Magazine](https://newnoisemagazine.com/interviews/interview-king-gizzard-lizard-wizard/). “We are fucked. You are fucked. You are going to hell, and hell is on the surface of Venus, and it’s not fun.” King Gizzard has written about Satan before (see *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* and *[I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](https://kglw.net/discography/im-in-your-mind-fuzz)*), and “Hell” is the nightmarish final confrontation with him,  although maybe also the beginning of another story based on vengeance. With blaring guitars, a fast tempo and an outro that remains a fan favorite all these years later, “Hell” is a perfect closer to *Infest the Rats’ Nest*.

Early versions of the song were included in the documentary *[RATTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6AzPaId5Qc&t=809s)* where the band jams the outro section at a slower pace, making a “doom metal” version. Recording sessions for the “hell” chants are also included in the film. The final studio version was played by Stu (vocals/bass/guitar), Joey (guitar/backing vocals), Cavs (drums/backing vocals), Cook (guitar/backing vocals), Ambrose (harmonica/backing vocals) and Eric (backing vocals). Before the release of *Infest the Rats’ Nest*, clips of the sound would be reversed and spliced to create a new track called [“Evil Star.”](https://kglw.net/song/evil-star?artist_id=1) First appearing in a [teaser video](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1141103174775738368?s=20) for the album uploaded on June 18th, 2019, it would later be used throughout the year as intro music for their shows. “Hell” was released as part of *Infest the Rats’ Nest* on August 16th, 2019.

“Hell” debuted on [2019-06-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-26-2019-howler-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at Howler in Naarm (Melbourne) during a surprise show. Like the rest of *Infest the Rats’ Nest*, it would be heavily played throughout the year with a performance from [2019-10-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-15-2019-alcatraz-milan-italy.html) making it into the tour film _[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)_. In 2020 the song was played a few times before the COVID-19 lockdown, returning to sets on [2021-07-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-25-2021-splendour-xr-online-the-internet.html) for the Splendour XR online festival. Since then it has remained in the band’s setlist with no major changes.

Professor of the Occult
Hear My Eyes: Suspiria
Dario Argento’s _[Suspiria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspiria)_ was released on February 1st, 1977 to mixed reviews. The horror film follows a ballet student named Suzy who attends a dance school only to be caught up in a series of surreal, supernatural deaths tied to witchcraft. It was seen as a gruesome yet unfocused movie by critics at the time, but has since become a classic of giallo cinema and is regarded as one of the best horror films ever made. The film was also given a soundtrack by the Italian progressive rock band [Goblin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin(band))_ which would go on to become a classic piece of ‘70s prog of its own accord. It makes perfect sense that King Gizzard would get involved somehow. At some point in the band’s development, the idea of creating a film score was an interest, and in 2019 they created the soundtrack for their concert film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. While largely composed of cuts from the band’s 2019 European tour, it also had a handful of original tracks based around synthesizers and keyboards. However, the band was excited to do more and an opportunity presented itself in early 2020.

Hear My Eyes is a project directed by Haydn Green where a band (or group of musicians) perform a new soundtrack live to a pre-existing film in various Naarm (Melbourne) theatres. Pairings to come from this project include Tropical Fuck Storm doing [their interpretation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qvy9EijcfE) of [No Country for Old Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Country_for_Old_Men), and The Murlocs [trying out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KNmPoFh9so) *[Two Hands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Hands_(1999_film))*. *Suspiria* was the fifth film tackled by Hear My Eyes and gathered a wide range of musicians. In its final form the band was Stu, Joey (Bullant) and Cavs from Gizzard, Leah Senior, Fia Fiell, Cold Hands Warm Heart and The Melbourne Chamber Choir. There was no name for the lineup but it would later be given a title by Gizzard: Professor of the Occult. The featured members were excited about the project. [Cavs said](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7hUPzaI_I7/?hl=en) "for as long as I've played music, I've wanted to be a part of a film score, but have never really had the knowledge of how it all works. Working with Hear My Eyes has taught me a lot about the process itself and working on this project is the perfect challenge for me, its a whole new world." 


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v2PIFWKgFiA?si=F2a9ArvkUOHoZG7v" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


Before the show took place a [rehearsal video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2PIFWKgFiA) was put on Hear My Eyes’ social media. The video is shot in black and white with VHS noise cluttering the images. The soundtrack was only played once on [2020-03-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/professor-of-the-occult-march-1-2020-hamer-hall-naarm-melbourne-victoria-australia.html) at Hamer Hall in Naarm (Melbourne). While the movie is ninety-nine minutes long, the soundtrack (based on both the Sydney Morning Herald article and the single recording of the event) is notably longer at a total of one hundred and four minutes. 


The intro features the progressive rock-inspired main theme, which picks up before the film starts rolling. It starts with Fia Fiell on synths and leads to a driving bass part from Stu, with Joey providing wah-wah accompaniment and Cavs drumming behind them. Think Pink Floyd’s [“Main Theme”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HCJHpWH8x0&pp=ygUVcGluayBmbG95ZCBtYWluIHRoZW1l) from Barbet Schroeder’s *[More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_(1969_film)*. The music stops for a long period of time with slight, creepy additions during the film’s dialogue. Eighteen minutes in, there’s a flourish of vocals from the Melbourne Chamber Choir for Pat’s death scene. Twenty-eight minutes in, more eerie instrumentation enters before leading to a peaceful Leah Senior piece which plays as the dancers perform throughout the film. At thirty-one minutes, as Suzy walks around the school, an ominous, space rock portion enters which once again brings the sounds of Pink Floyd to mind, specifically songs like [“Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcfgJrHo9XA) The tension is briefly cut by Leah’s song, but is drowned out by a low droning sound with building drums and piano before Suzy falls to the ground. Thirty-nine minutes in, Cavs lets loose with a brutal drum groove centered around the floor tom as the school is infested with maggots. This leads to a ‘70s prog inspired rocker as the head instructor Miss Tanner investigates the upper floor of the building. Forty-four minutes in there’s another synthscape from Fiell as the students sleep. At forty-nine minutes there’s a distorted drone that leads to the Leah Senior dancing piece for a brief moment, before being cut off early for Miss Tanner’s argument with the blind pianist Daniel. Another synthscape is injected as Suzy lays in bed next to her friend Sara. The main theme is reprised as Daniel walks with his dog. The Melbourne Chamber Choir sings over Daniel’s death. During the pool scene, the film is given surreal harp accompaniment. As Sara runs around the school, the score grows darker with the Melbourne Chamber Choir joining to provide an uneasy atmosphere. When Sara falls into a pit of barbed wire to be killed, Cavs crashes in with an intense metal drum beat. Following Sara’s death, Suzy investigates to a distorted synthscape. Later, as Suzy gets ready to sleep, she’s attacked by a giant bat. The music during this scene is the most “Gizzard” composition of the entire soundtrack— a metal track that would fit in perfectly on *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)* with sinister lead guitar reminiscent of *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* tracks like [“Big Fig Wasp.”](https://kglw.net/song/big-fig-wasp) Following this, the main theme is brought around one more time, now expanding into more synth and choir-heavy territories. As the school begins to break down, there’s a cathartic release which follows Suzy as she leaves. Over the sound of the witches screaming inside, the band reprises the main theme one final time, ending the film.

Reviews for the piece were universally positive. A [review for Beat](https://beat.com.au/review-hear-my-eyes-delivered-an-electrofying-technicolour-nightmare-with-its-suspiria-live-score/) written by Chris Swan said “performing as if they’d been doing it for years, the band knew exactly when to settle and let the film speak for itself, never over-playing moments or drowning out set pieces for the sake of spectacle. Silence is important in a film like Suspiria and they incorporated it perfectly.” Joe Hinchliffe for the [Sydney Morning Herald](https://www.smh.com.au/culture/music/the-horror-king-gizzard-and-pals-drench-cult-film-in-visceral-rock-20200302-p545zt.html) wrote “As the plot ramped into gear the band settled and allowed the movie to breathe, but there were certain scenes on which the King Gizz boys were never going to stay silent. A close-up of the sinister headmistress’ black boots stomping over a floor of writhing maggots served as the perfect setting for a metal number. None of it was subtle, but it was all rollicking good fun.” Following the performance, Hear My Eyes gave a few clips with soundboard audio. The first [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCkMkirkUyQ) was released on April 2nd, 2020 and features the bat scene’s thrash metal track. Another [promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzKAEXqE9Fc) from April 12th, 2022 showcases their main theme for *Suspiria*.

Following the performance, the band had intended to release it, though this has fallen by the wayside. Most info regarding the project has been from King Gizzard Reddit AMAs. In April of 2020 [Stu said](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnqcwja/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) “if not for COVID19 I reckon we'd be working on that Suspiria recording now. It'll be under the moniker 'Professor Of The Occult.’” A few months later in [another AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/o9u3ns/info_from_the_live_chat_predreams/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) he said “that one is on ice right now. Hopefully we pick it up down the track.” Before the premiere of the music video for “Dreams” [Stu responded](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i88j1r6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to a question about the soundtrack essentially repeating what was said in April of 2020. “We’ll record that one day. Would have done it now if not for the pandemic. Not gizz.” There was radio silence following this with the only other update coming from the [2022 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i88j1r6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). In it, Cavs said that it will “maybe” see a release in the future. While the concept of writing film scores remained after the performance (at least according to an [interview with Ambrose](https://www.allthingsloud.com/king-gizzard-interview/)), the soundtrack has not seen the light of day officially. That said, a fan-recorded tape of the entire show has circulated around the weirdo swarm, giving us a glimpse at what Professor of the Occult sounded like. There is also a fan edit of  *Suspiria* which is lined up with their soundtrack.
Chunky Shrapnel
Evil Star
Created out of reversed and slowed down clips of [“Hell,”](https://kglw.net/song/hell) “Evil Star” is an ominous soundscape that was first heard in a [promotional video](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1141103174775738368?s=20) for [Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest) released on June 18th, 2019. In the following weeks it became the band’s walk-on music for their various 2019 tours, with the first confirmed appearance being on [2019-06-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-28-2019-forum-theatre-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Forum Theatre in Naarm, Melbourne (as heard in the film *Live at the Forum Theatre*). It would become the first song heard in the 2020 film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* with a clean cut of the track making its way to the soundtrack. “Evil Star” would also be used in a [promo video](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1245819037734432769?s=20) for the movie. 
If you’re wondering why it’s called “Evil Star,” you can reverse the title and get “Rats Live,” fitting for the shows the band played throughout 2019.
Quarantine
“Quarantine” is a discordant synth piece played over various scenes of the band before their shows on the 2019 European tour in the film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*.  


The song has not been played live.
Parking
Taken from a performance of [“Open Water”](https://kglw.net/song/open-water) from [2019-10-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-8-2019-ancienne-belgique-brussels-belgium.html), “Parking” is a drum solo by Cavs that appears in the film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*.  
The song plays over footage of the band’s tour bus driver parking, hence the name. The song would also be used in a [promo](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1245819037734432769?s=20) for the movie.
Anamnesis
“Anamnesis” is a tranquil instrumental made of synthesizers and xylophones that plays on top of a collage of various footage from King Gizzard’s 2019 European tour. The word [anamnesis](https://kglw.net/blog/anamnesis-in-the-gizzverse.html) describes the process of remembering events from a previous life. In a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6niif/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Ambrose wrote that “Anamnesis” was his favorite part of the movie. The title would be referenced on [“Blue Morpho”](https://kglw.net/song/blue-morpho) and [“Magenta Mountain”](https://kglw.net/song/magenta-mountain) in the years after *[Chunky Shrapnel’s](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* release.


The song has never been played live.
A Brief History of Planet Earth
Appearing at the end of *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*, “A Brief History of Planet Earth” is a nineteen minute celebration of the band’s jams from their 2019 European tour, featuring Flightless-signed bands Stonefield and ORB. 


“A Brief History of Planet Earth” was the original title for *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)*, and would be used for a [behind the scenes video documenting that album’s creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ4c2v6qTY4) before winding up on *Chunky Shrapnel*. The track starts with an original composition, and leads to a combination of various live performances from 2019. The songs included are [“Rattlesnake”](https://kglw.net/song/rattlesnake) from [2019-10-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-5-2019-alexandra-palace-london-england.html) (0:46 — 1:43),  [“Head On/Pill”](https://kglw.net/song/head-on-pill) from [2019-10-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-19-2019-razzmatazz-barcelona-spain.html) (1:43 — 2:32 and 5:59 — 19:03), Stu’s flute playing in “Head On/Pill” from [2019-10-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-12-2019-columbiahalle-berlin-germany.html) (2:31 — 4:22), and another “Head On/Pill” from [2019-10-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-7-2019-tivolivredenburg-ronda-utrecht-netherlands.html) (4:22 — 5:59). 
K.G.
K.G.L.W. (Intro)
After a three year gap, King Gizzard presented the highly anticipated second installment of their “Explorations Into Microtonal Tuning” series. Having started with *[Flying Microtonal Banana[(https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)*, *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)* and its sister album *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)*, aimed in a different, more stylistically diverse direction with both albums carrying elements over from one another to create a cohesive whole. Nothing sets this up better than the first track “K.G.L.W.,” often referred to as “K.G.L.W. (Intro).” Fading in from the sound of wind and zurnas, we’re given an instrumental track with a central motif, before leading us into the album’s first big song [“Automation.”](https://kglw.net/song/automation?artist_id=1) *L.W.* features another track called [“K.G.L.W.”](https://kglw.net/song/kglw-outro?artist_id=1) (referred to as “K.G.L.W. (Outro)” that expands upon the motif and turns it into a raw, complicated and long metal closer for the pair.


A [Consequence of Sound track by track rundown](https://consequence.net/2020/11/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-kg-track-by-track/ of *K.G.* said of the track  “it’s always nice to start a story with a prelude.” To go deeper into it however, Stu’s appearance on [the Tape Notes podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODI0x2unT2Q) says a lot about the track. “This was one of the last. It was the very last that came together for *K.G.*, that’s for sure. This intro was. And the record needed a theme song, it honestly was as simple as that, and the gentle kind of, like, folk song thing was what was first but as soon as I kind of got this riff down and sent it around it was something that more than one person said, like, ‘we need to do this as a doom metal version.’”  
During that interview Stu played a number of demos recorded on his phone. The first is a rough draft of Stu trying to create the melody on an acoustic guitar over a drone note. The second version recorded two months later is on an unplugged electric guitar and features the main idea of the melody, though with a noticeably different structure and a new ending. A few months later again, he returned to the acoustic guitar and recorded the third demo, this time closer to the studio version. When it came time for the studio version, Stu started with two acoustic guitars panned left and right, with an additional two panned acoustics playing the lower octave. The rest is overdubbed on top of the guitars. He also notes that the [title track](https://kglw.net/song/flying-microtonal-banana?artist_id=1) of *Flying Microtonal Banana* is played in reverse at the start of the track. Liner notes indicate that only Ambrose (harmonica) and Stu (guitar/percussion/bass/keyboards/flute/sitar) played on the track, making for the least amount of members on a *K.G.* song.  
The album was released on November 20th 2020.


“K.G.L.W. (Intro)” was first played on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne), the band’s first post COVID-19 lockdown show and the start of their fully microtonal sets for the year. As one might expect, the song was the first in the set, with its companion piece being the finale (not including the encore). The song was played at most of the following microtonal shows, though sometimes preceded by the drum solo [“Fury.”](https://kglw.net/song/fury) After these shows ended, however, it was a bit unclear if the song would appear again. Yet while songs like [“The Hungry Wolf of Fate”](https://kglw.net/song/the-hungry-wolf-of-fate?artist_id=1) would bite the dust, the intro stuck around. The track reappeared on [2022-04-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-17-2022-event-lawn-at-virgin-hotels-las-vegas-las-vegas-nv-usa.html) on the Event Lawn at Virgin Hotels in Las Vegas to start the show yet again, this time introducing the microtonal set. At this show it was oddly not paired with “K.G.L.W. (Outro),” but that would change on [2022-4-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-20-2022-rialto-theatre-tucson-az-usa.html) at the Rialto Theatre in Tucson where the microtonal portion of the show was bookended with both parts  
This would be its role going forward, and the track made it to a number of 2022 shows before disappearing after [2022-10-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-5-2022-pne-forum-vancouver-canada.html), another show where the outro was not played. It became common for the outro to be played without the intro, which would eventually be abandoned totally in favor of miscellaneous microtonal tunes.

Automation
On 2017’s *[Murder of the Universe](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe)* there’s a story called “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe.” It tells of an “altered future,” where humanity has uploaded themselves to computer bodies to become cyborgs. In this state, the story’s protagonist, Han-Tyumi, feels empty, left with the unfulfillable urge to vomit and die. While Han-Tyumi obtains this in the end, he also brings the universe down with him. Life as an AI was never happy; it was a hollow world of no ambition, no passion, no love. Yet how did humanity decide that this was the trade-off worth pursuing? How was this transition from flesh to metal rationalized? Perhaps the answer lies in the first major song of [K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg), “Automation.” The song details the “last migration” into the newest form of primate, to avoid extinction at the end of the world. However, is transferring our beings to AI the next step for humanity, or is it our extinction? Will we be human when it is all said and done? This is what “Automation” questions, yet for Stu [it’s also something a lot simpler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODI0x2unT2Q). “I’m talking about AI probably being more intelligent than us eventually and probably taking over, like I know I sound like a psycho but like, it’s probably going to happen, right? And I guess this is my pledge allegiance song. It’s like ‘if you take over and I’m still alive I’m with you, I’m not against you. It’s cool. Don't kill me.” The song holds a lot on its shoulders as the first true introduction to what the *K.G.L.W.* pairing will be.
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HlPUTjznlV4?si=rXB-QBPtOTg_t4Aq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


“Automation” has its roots in the *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)* sessions. While most demos for the band’s songs share similarities to the final version, the demo for “Automation” could be classified as its own song with its own strengths. Starting with growling guitars and vocals like the feedback before the outro of [“Hell,”](https://kglw.net/song/hell?artist_id=1) it then pivots to a frantic metal section with unique lyrics about signing a contract for automation. The demo then slows to a chugging pace where the studio version’s lyrics appear, with staggered chords filling the chorus sections. An extra bridge section towards the middle of the song has unique lyrics than the studio version before going back into the verses. The song ends like it begins, with the fast paced metal section. The song was originally intended for the album but was cut late in development. When asked if there was any unused material from the album during the band’s *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* Reddit AMA, [Stu confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnqewrd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) there was one song but that it was “kinda shit.” He [also said](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnruxoi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that he had little intention of releasing the track, though signaled that he might rework it in the future. [Later that year(https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6kotc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu described what happened. “We got it to the stage you hear it on the demos album and then decided to cut it. I guess the album was around 70% done then?? I liked the riffs and the lyrics but it just didn't gel for me. I wanted the album to be lean anyways and I don't mind, we cut songs all the time.”  
While *Infest the Rats’ Nest* made it to shelves, “Automation” sat unused until the sessions for *K.G.* during the COVID-19 pandemic. In that same Reddit comment, Stu said “‘Automation’ (from *K.G.*) was a 2 piece jam Cavs and I recorded originally as a demo. I started ad libbing the ‘Automation’ (from *Rats’ Nest*) lyrics over the top and I realised it was perfect. It happened just like that…”  
In an episode of [the Tape Notes Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODI0x2unT2Q) Stu expanded upon the recording itself. “This was one that came together early in a real room with real people playing real instruments at the same time. It was a three piece kind of jam and it was never really anything. It was kind of… I don’t know we may have just come back from tour or something and we’re sort of like packing up or putting away gear or something and there happened to be a couple of mics laying around and Cavs and Joe and I were just jamming on, like, that groove. And I just, like, plugged a laptop there and clicked record because it was all kind of there. And I didn’t really think too much of it until we were making music in lockdown and I was scouring through recordings trying to find things that had a live feel because I missed it at this stage and we hadn’t worked out how to be a band again. And I found this recording, I could never find the actual multitrack session, it might have been recorded on somebody else's computer or something cause all I have is, like, a bounce down, like a mixdown that’s just two tracks. But anyway that became the basis of the song. So all I did was I cut it up a little bit. It’s a shit recording… but ‘Automation’ is just overdubs on top of that track.” Cavs backed up this story in a [Consequence of Sound K.G. rundown](https://consequence.net/2020/11/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-kg-track-by-track/). “This track stemmed from a two-piece jam with myself and Stu probably almost a year ago now. I was listening to a lot of desert blues and African rhythms at the time and I always try to slot them in wherever I can… I like to play… drums.. You will hear the exact same lyrics in the track of the same name on our recent demos album, which was a *Rats’ Nest* off-cut. Stu is really keen on robots and I’m pretty sure he’s an AI.”  
According to the liner notes, only Ambrose (harmonica/synthesizer), Cavs (drums) and Stu (guitar/percussion/vocals/keyboards/bass/flute) ended up on the studio version.

The demo for “Automation” was the first to be released on October 1st, 2020. While the studio version of “Automation” was a [single](https://www.discogs.com/master/1868214-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Automation) for *K.G.*, it was not promoted in the usual way with an official video. The first glimmer of what was to come would be in the [fourth Gizzymail](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/xis7.html), where Stu shares a gif of Cook being wrapped in tin foil with this caption; “Our next video clip is the most DIY thing ever? I’m not sure how we could have made it more DIY tbh. We’re getting waaaayyy more paranoid by the day…” On the 19th [the Twitter account tweeted](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1318415596166336512?s=20) “I pledge allegiance to our A.I. overlord.” [The next day](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1318545900172619776?s=20) the lyrics to the track were revealed. Later they would [drop torrent links](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/automation) containing both a number of clips from the band, as well as the complete stems for the track. This was done with the purpose of fans being able to remix the song as well as create their own music videos. The provided clips show the band wearing tinfoil cyborg outfits with occasional silver face paint dancing around their headquarters with lights, playing with a football outside, and messing around with tinfoil covered instruments in a room that is also covered with foil. The creation of the various clips is featured throughout the documentary *Sleeping Monster*. When Ambrose was asked who was directing the video, he said “who knows? Apparently me. See what happens. Stu wanted to foil the room so we foiled it all and that’s about as the concept will go.” While there was initially a [copyright issue](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1318436626578599936?s=20) blocking the videos from being uploaded to YouTube, the band would lift it and [feature a number of fan made videos in their Gizzymail newsletter](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/xznn.html), though a [Reddit AMA with the band](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge7iyl3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) floated the idea of holding a fan vote where the winner would be uploaded to the band’s YouTube channel with the creator’s permission. [In a Reddit AMA from 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i88ow32/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu would say that the “Automation” video shoot was one of his favorites. After a [quick tease](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHPERxYlyrC/?igshid=zcfii7chlus5) showing “Automation” on vinyl, *K.G.* was released on November 20th, 2020.  
The phrase “bald primate” from the lyrics was later used in the *[Ice, Death…](https://kglw.net/discography/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava)* track [“Mycelium.”](https://kglw.net/song/mycelium?artist_id=1)

“Automation” was first played live during the band’s first post-lockdown show on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). This was the first of a number of fully microtonal shows that year, and “Automation” would become a fixture of them as a standalone track. A few shows in, the band began to mix things up with “Automation” becoming the first song in a three song suite of “Automation” > [“D-Day”](https://kglw.net/song/d-day?artist_id=1) > [“Some of Us.”](https://kglw.net/song/some-of-us?artist_id=1) The song would continue to be played going into 2022 with its first appearance of the year being on [2022-04-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-11-2022-humphreys-concerts-by-the-bay-san-diego-ca-usa.html) at Humphrey’s Concerts By the Bay in San Diego, where it would transition into [“Minimum Brain Size.”](https://kglw.net/song/minimum-brain-size?artist_id=1) For the next few shows it took this form before changing on [2022-05-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-22-2022-mr-smalls-theatre-millvale-pa-usa.html) for a one off [“O.N.E.”](https://kglw.net/song/o-n-e?artist_id=1) > “D-Day” > “Automation.” Going to [2022-10-10](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-10-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html) the song would see a new use as part of “Automation” > [“Honey”](https://kglw.net/song/honey?artist_id=1) > [“Sleep Drifter.”](https://kglw.net/song/sleep-drifter?artist_id=1) Its final appearance of 2022 on [2022-10-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-23-2022-the-anthem-washington-dc-usa.html) was an “Automation” > [“Rattlesnake.”](https://kglw.net/song/rattlesnake?artist_id=1) Going into 2023 the song was either a standalone track or an oddball piece of different medleys.

Minimum Brain Size
The COVID-19 pandemic shut a lot of people in due to lockdowns. With nowhere to go, many people found their only escape through phone screens and computers, but out of that came a lot of instability. You could be fine, sure, but others found themselves falling into conspiracy theories and bigotry, or just trolling and provocation. The result of this loneliness and the echo chambers of extremism can be tragic. In 2019, a string of shootings at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand took place, with fifty-one dead and forty injured by the end of the attacks. The perpetrator was a right wing extremist who was [described as a “recluse” by neighbors](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/111346747/christchurch-shooting-accused-brenton-tarrant-described-as-a-recluse-by-neighbours). He was a product of racist, conspiracy-minded online communities. [Reports](https://apnews.com/article/intelligence-agencies-shootings-brenton-tarrant-new-zealand-new-zealand-mosque-attacks-d8217fa30fe4eeba45fb001b77857385) state that he had been a 4chan user since 2014. [His manifesto was released on 8chan](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/aspi-explains-8chan/) before the shootings occurred. These communities target young, disenfranchised men and lure them in with the “answers” — those being conspiracy theories, racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, etc. Dr. John Battersby, an expert on terrorism, [said in the aftermath of the shootings](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/111324932/christchurch-mosque-shootings-naive-to-think-this-wouldnt-happen-here) "they feel as though they are losing their place as the dominant group and their culture is under attack from multiculturalism. What's happened since 9/11 is there's been this big international conspiracy theory that Muslims are the major threat. They think 'they're undermining our culture and identity and also physically attacking us so we've got to fight back.' The type of things these people think and write about ethnic and religious minorities are truly dreadful and hateful." [In response to the shootings and the tide of online right wing radicalization](https://www.nme.com/en_au/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-album-kg-interview-2020-2833101), Joey wrote the song “Minimum Brain Size.” While [promoting](https://consequence.net/2020/11/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-kg-track-by-track/) *[K.G](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)* he said “2020 has been a lot of things, but it has mainly kept us confined to our homes and more significantly, to our screens. It truly is a scary world, the online mind-hive. We live in the age of the comment section. Where Trolls have their own farms and little Incels run free. But just remember… It's pathetic bro.” The lyrics tackle humanity’s ability to be cruel, presenting a middle finger to the incels and trolls of the world. Importantly, “Minimum Brain Size” does not fear them. It goes to great lengths to call them exactly what they are: pathetic and weak. The third song on *K.G.*, released on November 20th, 2020, “Minimum Brain Size” is the first glance at the inner politics of the album.

A solo version of the song played by Joey is at the beginning of the documentary *Sleeping Monster*, making it the earliest archival material for the song. Liner notes state that Ambrose (harmonica), Cavs (drums/percussion), Joey (vocals/guitar/bağlama/JUNO/bass) and Stu (flute/sitar) recorded parts for the song, with Joey’s sister and member of [Love Migrate](https://kglw.net/page/associated-music), Bella Walker, adding backing vocals. The mixing session for the song, with an overdub by Joey, appears in the video *[KG LW MIX SESH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVV9Kjd10hA)* with the band joking about a sequel for the song “Minimum Brain Size 4.” Joey was given the mixing credit for the song on K.G. On December 13th, 2020, as part of Gizzymail, the band released the only episode of *[GUITAR WITH “WALKY JAKE”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC-cJvIZiRo)*, a short-lived series where Joey teaches viewers how to play a song. The video focuses on “Minimum Brain Size.”

Since *K.G.*’s release, “Minimum Brain Size” has been played consistently throughout the band’s tours. It debuted on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) as part of the first of many fully microtonal sets of 2021 and the first show post-lockdown. On the next night ([2021-02-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-24-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html)) the song came out of [“Honey,”](https://kglw.net/song/honey?artist_id=1) marking the first instance of the song in a longer jam. Its next performance would be on [2021-02-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-26-2021-sidney-myer-music-bowl-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) where it would slide into [“Sleep Drifter.”](https://kglw.net/song/sleep-drifter?artist_id=1) The next few shows move away from the jams back to the standalone rendition based on available info. The song would continue to be played after the microtonal sets were retired, starting with an appearance at The Return of the Curse of Timeland Festival on [2022-03-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). For 2022, the song appeared on [2022-04-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-11-2022-humphreys-concerts-by-the-bay-san-diego-ca-usa.html) after [“Automation,”](https://kglw.net/song/automation?artist_id=1) a pairing which would return on [2022-05-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-may-14-2022-cervecera-hrcules-santiago-de-quertaro-mexico.html). Other shows would see new pairings, such as “Minimum Brain Size” > [“Billabong Valley”](https://kglw.net/song/billabong-valley?artist_id=1) on [2022-10-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-27-2022-orpheum-theater-new-orleans-la-usa.html) and [“Doom City”](https://kglw.net/song/doom-city?artist_id=1) > “Minimum Brain Size” on [Halloween night](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-31-2022-the-criterion-oklahoma-city-ok-usa.html). Live versions are typically close to the studio version outside of any potential transitions to other microtonal songs.

Straws in the Wind
The only Ambrose-led track on *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)*, “Straws in the Wind” feels like it was designed to get a crowd going. With its anthemic chorus and infectious 3/4 groove, the song is a powerhouse that allows Ambrose to really work the audience. The lyrics aren’t as fun though, as Ambrose rattles through the complications of the COVID-19 pandemic, noting how the media sensationalized the situation to create a state of paranoia. The chorus asks if this is the end of the world through the image of, well, straws in the wind. It could allude to a tornado throwing the contents of crop fields around, or it could be something more man-made, plastic going everywhere. Whatever you interpret, “Straws in the Wind” is certainly a song about that feeling that this is the end times.

A demo for the song reveals what Gizzard was thinking early on. At eleven minutes and twenty seconds in length, the demo is in a different key, has a different structure and is, of course, much longer than the final version. There’s also a difference in guitar; this version features distorted electric rather than the bright acoustics. [According to Ambrose](https://consequence.net/2020/11/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-kg-track-by-track/), the lyrics were a reflection on the COVID-19 pandemic and the chaos of the world at the time. “This acoustic boogie came together around March this year. Stu hit me up to have a crack at writing some lyrics for it. It was one of the first song ideas for *K.G.* that came together. At the peak of the toilet paper crisis, it was so hard not to write a ‘Sign of the Times’ at that point of complete chaos. I tried singing in a different register to what I’d normally with the intention in mind to match the impending doom I was hearing in the music.” In a [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6nfa6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from November of 2020, Lucas said that he believed the acoustic guitar parts in the song were recorded using an iPhone. The liner notes for *K.G.* show that only Ambrose (vocals/harmonica/keyboards), Cavs (drums/percussion), Cook (guitar/piano/keyboards/sitar) and Stu (guitar/vocals/bass/keyboards/percussion/flute) recorded parts for the song. While a music video for the song would be released first, “Straws in the Wind” was released as part of *K.G.* on November 20th, 2020.

The first tease for the music video was in the [first Gizzymail](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/xznn.html) which featured a photo of Stu playing acoustic guitar in front of a green screen with the caption “Jason’s back on the tools with a new clip coming along.” In the [second Gizzymail](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/xviv.html) was a photo of the inside of a windmill with guitars hanging on the wall. Stu captioned it “Jase is also still chipping away at a new video clip too. Out next week. He painstakingly recreated joeys bedroom inside the windmill that he lives in.” [Gizzymail 4](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/xis7.html) would link to an unlisted YouTube video called *[straws in the wind BTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7NJxjFRJak)* which shows Stu and Ambrose messing around in front of the green screen. Stu wrote “This is how we made Straws In The Wind. Life’s weird at the moment. Funny and also not funny at the same time hahaha.” Jason Galea’s [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioqgrYorhkU) for “Straws in the Wind" would be released on September 15th, 2020 with a [single release](https://www.discogs.com/master/1845366-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Straws-In-The-Wind) alongside it. It shows the band playfully performing the song in a field with flowers and windmills which is then hit by a tornado, sweeping the band off their feet into the sky. In the air the band continues to play, with a 3D Ambrose breakdancing to the music and Joey mimicking the playing of a flute with an air blower. The end of the video fades to an orange color which sets up the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0BEw4pqvAo) for [“Some of Us,”](https://kglw.net/song/some-of-us?artist_id=1) filmed using a thermal camera. When the video was released, it was [given this caption](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1305855757745819648?s=20): “We shot trash around the room with a leaf blower and pretended that we were in a trash tornado. What has the world come to.” When asked about the DIY approach to the video in an [interview for All Things Loud](https://www.allthingsloud.com/king-gizzard-interview/), Ambrose said it was because of the pandemic. “Definitely a product of the pandemic, yeah. We were in Melbourne on an intense lockdown when we did the video for ‘Straws in the Wind.’ In fact, we were in our studio when a stage four lockdown was announced and we realised that – again – we wouldn’t be able to see each other for who knows how long. I jokingly suggested we should go to the hardware store, buy a leaf blower and get a green screen. The guys laughed and said, ‘Ok Ambrose, cool, you can run the reigns on this one’, so I bought a robe, Ugg boots and some shitty sunglasses. We were gonna film it the next day all by ourselves when Jason Galea suggested he come round and help set up the lights. He filmed half of the video and I filmed the other half, and then he turned it into a little masterpiece.” This would be the first video released after the departure of Eric Moore on August 25th, 2020 and the first video for Galea since 2019’s [“Fishing For Fishies.”](https://kglw.net/song/fishing-for-fishies?artist_id=1) Stu later named the video as one of his favorites to make in a [2022 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i88ow32/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Jason Galea uploaded a [behind the scenes look](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKQG1pxp8mT/?img_index=1) to his Instagram page in January of 2021. The breakdancing Ambrose would later appear in the [countdown clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh-NTKaPXiQ) for [“Smoke and Mirrors”](https://kglw.net/song/smoke-and-mirrors?artist_id=1) during the final verse (14:32 to be precise).

“Straws in the Wind” was first played at the band’s first post-pandemic show on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) with a runtime of almost ten minutes. The second night of the Croxton shows ([2021-02-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-24-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html)) was a minute shorter. Even in its earliest moments it was proving to be a jam vehicle that allowed Ambrose to get the crowd going — making them sing the chorus. On [2021-02-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-26-2021-sidney-myer-music-bowl-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) the song would be the start of a long medley of “Straws in the Wind” > [“Sleep Drifter”](https://kglw.net/song/sleep-drifter?artist_id=1) > [“Honey.”](https://kglw.net/song/honey?artist_id=1) Most of the time, however, the song would be a standalone track. While some microtonal songs would be dropped off of sets after 2021, “Straws in the Wind” continued to be a prominent track often stretching above ten minutes in length, a far cry from the five minute studio version we hear on *K.G.*.

Some Of Us
While the previous song on *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)*, [“Straws in the Wind,”](https://kglw.net/song/straws-in-the-wind?artist_id=1) talks about the uncertain times we face, “Some of Us” provides a similar yet larger topic. Humans have existed for millions of years and in that time we’ve seen civilizations rise and fall. Historians have documented our path from apes swinging around to technologically advanced creatures, yet despite having knowledge of our previous failings, only some of us take them with any importance. Instead of learning from the past and the knowledge we have, a portion of us fail to recognize injustice or catastrophe by pushing it away as nothing of importance or by worsening the issue through prejudice and bigotry. In fact, the song directly mentions how the COVID-19 pandemic was used as fuel for xenophobia across the world. “Some of Us” calls out those who ignore the warning signs with a reminder that “everything turns into dust.”


In an [article for Consequence of Sound](https://consequence.net/2020/11/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-kg-track-by-track/) the origins were laid out. “This one was written by Cook but sung by Stu and was conceived in 2019 in a demo which later became a more fleshed out version of itself in the beginnings of *K.G.* once other contributions were made by band members remotely. Its lyrical content much like ‘Straws in the Wind’ is also observational of 2020’s chaos, but instead uses historical references in an attempt to relate current events which may seem apocalyptic as mere occurrences that have continuously peppered humanity’s journey thus far. It definitely has some nihilistic themes in it, but they’re ones of optimistic nihilism, as there’s always good times that come with the bad.” Later, [they wrote](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1293910759760519172?s=20) “This Cook penned, Stu sung song came together early this year as the world was slowly descending into madness, but before it was truly on fire. Can't wait to show y’all some more tunes before we go down in flames.” In the end, the only members to play on “Some of Us” were Ambrose (harmonica), Cavs (drums), Cook (piano/bass/percussion/guitar/keyboards/synthesizer/clarinet/flute) and Stu (vocals/guitar/clavinet/xylophone), with Cook getting a lead songwriting credit — making this the only *K.G.* song with that feature. “Some of Us” was released as part of *K.G.* on November 20th, 2020. On vinyl copies of the album, it wraps up the first side with a fade out leading into “Ontology.”

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0BEw4pqvAo) for “Some of Us,” directed, edited and shot by John Angus Stewart, was released on August 13th, 2020 alongside a [single release](https://www.discogs.com/master/1845370-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Some-Of-Us). In the [first Gizzymail](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/xznn.html), Stu gave some background information. “If you haven't picked up on it yet, ‘Some of Us’ is shot with a thermal camera. John had to pretend he was in the military to rent one. Instead of picking up light and colours, it only picks up heat. That’s why it’s two toned. It doesn't care what it’s looking at, it just cares if it’s hot or cold. We had it on the black and white setting first but it was too scary…” As Stu explained, “Some of Us” utilizes a thermal camera which the band plays around with to create some nightmarish imagery. It would be the last video released before the departure of Eric Moore on August 25th, 2020, though he had no involvement in the video or *K.G.*.

“Some of Us” saw a live debut on [2021-02-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-24-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) with its ending cut entirely. The song was first played on its own and would remain that way until April when the song would begin to get involved in a medley of [“Automation”](https://kglw.net/song/automation?artist_id=1) > [“D-Day”](https://kglw.net/song/d-day?artist_id=1) > “Some of Us.” The song’s final performance was on [2021-04-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-22-2021-enmore-theatre-eora-sydney-australia.html), which was later released as *[Live in Sydney ‘21](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-sydney-21)*. This makes it the least played *K.G.* song with a total of only four performances.
Ontology
Coming right out of [“Some of Us”](https://kglw.net/song/some-of-us?artist_id=1) is a Western-sounding but existential track called “Ontology.” Like the field the song takes its title from, “Ontology” asks a number of questions about life, yet never answers them, saying that it’s easier to live by not thinking for yourself. If we don’t weigh ourselves down in existential thought, we can be free to do whatever we want. “Ontology” is a rare *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)* song, not being played since early 2022, yet its unique tone and big questions create a strong start to the album’s second side.


[According to Ambrose](https://www.allthingsloud.com/king-gizzard-interview/), Stu had his own questions regarding the song while making it. “I remember Stu showing me that one and I thought it was so sick. It was like a Western, Cowboys and Indians race going on. He had that chorus thingy going on and I asked him if he’s planned on singing on it. He said he wasn’t sure yet, so I did some harmonica instead and it became one of those instrumental chorus tracks. I sang on it with Stu too, but he didn’t want to call it ‘Ontology’ at first. He didn’t like the word. I had to talk him into keeping it.” Ambrose seems to really enjoy the song [saying to Consequence of Sound](https://consequence.net/2020/11/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-kg-track-by-track/) “whenever I hear this track I want to start galloping around the room with a broom like Happy Gilmore! It has that immediate energy in the driving rhythm from the drums and percussion that propels you into such a triumphant instrumental chorus. With a cowboy hat nod to our second album, *[Eyes Like the Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)*, ‘Ontology’ flies off into the desert with a transcending shout that kicks against the pricks, ‘Be Free!.’” Liner notes for K.G. state that Ambrose (percussion/harmonica/vocals), Cavs (drums), Cook (guitar) and Stu (vocals/guitar/bass/keyboards/flute/vibraphone/violin/horns/clavinet) recorded parts of the song with Stu doing the heavy lifting, recording a total of nine different instrument parts — the most on any *K.G.* track. “Ontology” was released on November 20th, 2020 as the sixth song of *K.G.* That same day the song appeared in a [video](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1329902081285603329?s=20) promoting the launch of the band’s US Gizzverse online store. On vinyl copies of the album “Ontology” opens up side two and starts with a fade-in of the ending of “Some of Us.”


“Ontology” debuted on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) as part of the first show after COVID-19 lockdown and the first fully microtonal show of 2021. It would also be played the next night ([2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-24-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html)), with these two performances seeing the song as a standalone track with a drum solo at the start, a faster pace and a high energy ending. On [2021-02-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-26-2021-sidney-myer-music-bowl-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Naarm, it would be rearranged. This show, released as *[Live at Melbourne ‘21](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-melbourne-21)*, features the song coming out of [“O.N.E.”](https://kglw.net/song/o-n-e?artist_id=1) The song would not be played again until [2021-04-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-1-2021-fremantle-arts-centre-fremantle-australia.html) where it appeared yet again as a solo track. Skipping a show, “Ontology” would be paired with [“Minimum Brain Size”](https://kglw.net/song/minimum-brain-size?artist_id=1) on [2021-04-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-23-2021-riverstage-brisbane-australia.html) at the Riverstage in Brisbane. This would be the final performance of the track in 2021 and from here it would fall nearly completely off setlists. With [2022-04-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-18-2022-event-lawn-at-virgin-hotels-las-vegas-las-vegas-nv-usa.html) on the Event Lawn at Virgin Hotels in Las Vegas, it was once again played on its own (though in a notably sloppy fashion with Lucas and Ambrose losing their places and Stu almost missing the first “be free.”) The day after ([2022-04-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-19-2022-marquee-theatre-tempe-az-usa.html)) “Ontology” was played for the final time, now coming out of “Sleep Drifter.”

Intrasport
While not the only Joey-fronted song on *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)*, it's hard to argue that this is not the fan-favorite of his contributions. “Intrasport” is a house song at the center of the album focused on bloodshed and transformation. While the title is striking, it is not an actual word. Instead, the title is a combination of intra (inside or within) and sport (competition, game). The title could then explain the song’s purpose: hunting your own kind or even yourself. Given the murderous lyrics, it makes a lot of sense. It was the last song from *K.G.* to be released as a single before they moved on to *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)* but it still holds a soft spot in many hearts.


Joey’s inspirations for “Intrasport” come from all over the place. For a [Consequence of Sound explanation of K.G.](https://consequence.net/2020/11/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-kg-track-by-track/), he wrote that it was “my attempt at writing a Bollywood inspired, early 2000’s Housey-cum-RnB banger. It was definitely fun to experiment with the vibes found on this track. Britney… duet? 2021? It’d be a dream come true tbh.” In [Gizzymail #7](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/00un.html), Joey explained the song like this: “I think my idea for ‘Intrasport’ was a Turkish version of a 90s house song — It gets me one step closer to a duet with Darren Hayes from Savage Garden.” He would also cite Darren Hayes (alongside isolation) as an influence on the song during a [November 2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6pije/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). In that same AMA [Joey said](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6mtjs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the gruesome lyrics were inspired by the dark web. The COVID-19 pandemic largely influenced the creation of *K.G.*, considering how everyone was recording and writing on their own and “Intrasport” was largely created by Joey himself (he has the sole mixing credit), while also being presented late into the album’s creation. [Ambrose said](https://www.allthingsloud.com/king-gizzard-interview/): “‘Intrasport’ came about because Joey was at home and none of us were around him. He went free for all. He was listening to Savage Garden and guilty pleasures like that, although he wouldn’t call it a guilty pleasure. He wears that shit like a badge of honour. He also wrote [‘Minimum Brain Size’](https://kglw.net/song/minimum-brain-size?artist_id=1) which I absolutely love, but ‘Intrasport’ came late to the game. He’s done that a few times where he came late with a track and everyone’s like, ‘fuck’s sake, the album’s done’ and then he shows us the song and it’s really good. So then we cut one out and replace it with his. I remember hearing his ‘ah! ah!’ heavy breathing on ‘Intrasport’ and loving it, it’s really grown on me. It’s definitely the odd one out on the album.” The creation process behind the song was detailed by Cavs in the previously mentioned [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6uwwi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3): “Joey had made the track with samples and then I drummed over the top. It's mostly Joey's editing and mixing that gives it a nice blend.. was very fun to play!” In the end only Stu (clavinet/synthesizer/Mellotron), Joey (vocals/guitar/synthesizer/Elektron Digitakt/percussion) and Cavs (drums) would play on the track, based on liner notes. “Intrasport” was released as part of *K.G.* on November 20th, 2020. [Stu said](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/27/1000902256/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-on-making-microtonal-music-during-a-pandemic) that Joey was ecstatic about the track as it tapped into his long standing interest in electronic music. “Joe’s joke is that ‘Intrasport’ is his, like, government sanctioned electronic house track or whatever… Joe is pretty stoked about being able to take it to this place, for sure.”

In a [Gizzymail newsletter](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/x9lq.html) promoting the concert film for *[Live in San Francisco ‘16](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-san-francisco-16)*, they showed a video of an apartment with green lights coming out of the windows. The caption read “we just shot a music video in this haunted house.” The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05s4dEcAgMI) referenced was for “Intrasport,” which would be released on November 19th, 2020 — a day before the release of *K.G.*, making it the final video for the album. It was directed, edited and shot by John Angus Stewart and features the band completely still in various poses while Joey sings the song. At the end the band begins to dance one by one while undressing. [Stewart explained the video](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/00un.html) like this: “The Clip was shot in my tiny studio apartment. For the main reason that it’s the smallest place I know that someone lives in. The aim was to find the 50/50 split: feeling lonely at a party but surrounded by people. Feeling like you are the only one there and that nobody really understands you (but you still have to bring it). I used 35mm anamorphic to give the small space as much panoramic effect as I could muster. Sometimes the smallest of spaces feel huge when you are partying, why do you think everyone always gathers in the kitchen or bathroom?" On the walls of the apartment are posters from the 2019 European tour. The main one featuring the three cats listening to headphones is from [2019-10-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-16-2019-x-tra-zrich-switzerland.html) at X-TRA in Zurich while the other depicting a King Gizzard board game is from [2019-10-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-2-2019-o2-academy-leeds-leeds-england.html) at the O2 Academy in Leeds. [Prints of  the video](https://phcfilms.com/store) were sold by PHC Films in late 2020.


While the song ended up being a fan-favorite from *K.G.*, it has yet to be performed live. In the [live chat during the premiere of the music video for “Dreams”](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/o9u3ns/info_from_the_live_chat_predreams/?share_id=wWu-lPg9iNLrxqKN7ylH0&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) it was said that the band would play the track one day. [Lucas has gone on record](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6nke5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to say that he’s excited to play the song live. Before the Remlinger residency in 2023 the song was [supposedly soundchecked](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/15ruzzi/guys_theyre_soundchecking_intrasport/), though there hasn’t been any evidence to support the claim. [Joey has however gone on record](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k75cq3a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to say that “Intrasport” will happen live.
Oddlife
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the entire music industry stopped. While many had 2020 tours planned, the restrictions locked everyone in place. For artists who required touring to make a living (as streaming and album sales unfortunately don’t pay enough these days) the lockdown presented a threat. For the venues it was also a troubling time as their primary reason to exist was now no longer an option. How can you support a live business if there are no live acts? Everyone had to restructure and rethink how they were going about things and Gizzard was no exception. The band has essentially had to relearn how to make music during the pandemic as they couldn’t jam in person. There also must have been some writing on the wall that times were changing as drummer and manager [Eric Moore left the band](https://www.nme.com/news/music/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-drummer-eric-moore-leaves-the-band-2736813) during the pandemic to focus on his own endeavors with Flightless Records. For a band that’s constantly working and on the move, the pandemic must have felt like hitting a brick wall. “Oddlife” was not the first time the band covered the idea of touring. One of the band’s biggest songs, [“Robot Stop,”](https://kglw.net/song/robot-stop?artist_id=1) was a reflection on the tiring struggle of being on the road. However there’s something about “Oddlife” that feels a bit more magical, though also a bit more candid. Stu sings that the rock and roll lifestyle is bad for him physically and poetically details the routine of touring while Ambrose raps about the confusion and exercise of it all. The ending thesis is that the band lives an odd life compared to most. In some ways it feels like a breath of relief to not be on the road, yet there’s also a bit of magic in there — there’s “sugar plum fairies” to meet and hallowed grounds to play on. The life of a musician in a rock band is exhausting, sure, but also a gift.


Based on the liner notes for *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)*, “Oddlife” was recorded by Ambrose (vocals/percussion), Cavs (drums/percussion), Cook (synthesizer), Lucas (percussion), and Stu (vocals/guitar/bass/percussion/synthesizer/piano/keyboards) and was at least partially recorded in person. According to an [interview](https://www.allthingsloud.com/king-gizzard-interview/) with Ambrose for All Things Loud, “that song is about touring, or at least that was the vibe I got from reading the lyrics that Stu sent me. It became obvious to me that we still needed something going during that later part of the song, and Stu was slowly losing his love for the track. There’s been moments where he’s had that and I’ve stepped in to say, “*nah, that’s sick, let me try!*” So I went into the other room and quickly wrote those lyrics. The guys came back from lunch and then we banged it all out. The rest of the song slowly formed its shape, and we were all dancing around and laughing in the control room.” In another [article for Consequence of Sound](https://consequence.net/2020/11/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-kg-track-by-track/), he said: “We’ve always hit the ground running from the start. Everything moves pretty fast in the Gizzverse and touring has always been a massive part of it. 2020 put a stop to that, so this song turned into a nice reflection on all those fun times we’ve had over the years out on the road. We are so grateful for all these weird experiences and wouldn’t change a thing. Can’t wait to get back to it as soon as it’s safe to do so again!” According to a performance on [2022-10-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-11-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html), it’s Cook’s favorite Gizzard song. It was released on November 20th as part of *K.G.*. It was later used in a [video](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1329964991689080838?s=20) of Ambrose singing in the shower, posted for the launch of the band’s [US Gizzverse store](https://gizzverse.com/).

The song’s live debut was on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) towards the end of the set. Fittingly, the show was the first post-lockdown performance, making the song a poignant track for the whole affair. It would be played the next day on [2021-02-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-24-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at the beginning of the set where it would remain for many microtonal shows. While 2022 would see the end of fully microtonal shows, the song continued to be played regularly with a total of fifteen performances throughout 2022. The song was still mostly played on its own but [2022-10-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-11-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html), for example, showed that the song was still capable of leading into another. In 2023 the song’s frequency was cut, making it to only two shows during the European tour. As for the song’s live structure, it’s not notably different from the studio version and played close to what you would expect. Outside of the band, the song would be played at Cavs’ first [drum seminar at Drumtek](https://youtu.be/M9O9b-U0nl4?si=f8iCscpGMaW8Wgl_) in Northcote, Victoria.

Honey
It may be surprising, but “Honey” is one of the most documented King Gizzard songs so far because not only are there multiple demos out there, but Stu himself has extensively elaborated on the song’s recording as part of [KEXP’s Isolated Tracks series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODI0x2unT2Q). This is partially due to the COVID-19 lockdown, which no doubt influenced the recording and lyricism of both *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)* and *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)* and prevented the band from touring. Stuck with nowhere to go, the band wrote about it, released that material, put out the first demo and got candid about how it was put together. In fact “Honey” is a song about COVID, at least in some regard. In a broken, chaotic world there’s a happy, loving and unwavering relationship which is the focal point of the track. Even in the darkness of a pandemic and environmental destruction, there’s still joy. Coming off of the brutal and environmentally conscious *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)* as the first part of their microtonal output, it may be easy to expect some nihilism but “Honey” showed that K.G. would symbolize more.

The song originated from [“Sleep Drifter”](https://kglw.net/song/sleep-drifter?artist_id=1) jams as far back as 2018. The song’s main riff can be heard during the intro of [2018-06-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-20-2018-variety-playhouse-atlanta-ga-usa.html) at the Variety Playhouse in Atlanta. Stu remarked in the Isolated Tracks episode, “You just get these moments where you look at each other and it’s just like ‘oh woah, that five seconds there is an entire song.” The first demo (released on *[Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2)*) is an instrumental full-band jam. Missing are the acoustics that define the final version and the drum beat going into the verse which is replaced by a more staggered approach. Other than that, “Honey (Demo 1)” is pretty close to the finalized version. A second demo (found on *[Demos Vol. 5: Music To Think Existentially To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-5-music-to-think-existentially-to)*) is a bit rougher sounding with more distortion on the guitars but stands very close to the first demo. [According to Joey](https://consequence.net/2020/11/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-kg-track-by-track/) it originated as a band demo but due to the pandemic became something else, losing the in person feel. “Written by Stu, ‘Honey’ is one of the first songs we had for this record. Early iterations of the track were much more band oriented and meandering. But alas, the dreaded pandemic kept us confined to our respective dwellings and those versions didn’t make it past the demo stage. It is a true artifact of trying to make a record in lockdown and having to find ways around not being able to play in the same room together.” When it comes to the actual studio version there’s a few interesting notes. There are two drum parts on the track panned to left and right. They were recorded with an overhead and kick drum mic, bounced through a Tascam tape machine and sound, to quote Stu “really, really bad.” To make up for this, he added multiple percussion samples to make the beat stand out more. The main acoustic guitar was recorded onto an iPhone by Stu which allows the part to cut through the mix (though this is not the first time the band has done this — [“12 Bar Bruise”](https://kglw.net/song/12-bar-bruise?artist_id=1) utilized it back in 2012). There are two bass parts with one carrying the main song and the other (most likely recorded on another bass) kicking in at 3:24. The vocals were recorded through an AKG DGN99 E mic and are heavily compressed. Some of the harmony vocals are copied from the foundation and pitched up. Outside of the base track the song features pitched Mellotron, organ and harmonica (which was largely cut). More technical info (EQ, bus, mastering) can be found on the third episode of KEXP’s Isolated Tracks. Stu said that for Gizzard the song was “restrained” when it came to recording, with far less to juggle than other songs. According to Stu, the lyrics saw multiple revisions before making it to the record. “It took a long time for this song to develop and it went through a lot of versions of the words and the final version of the lyrics were definitely kind of changed and written to reflect my state of mind this year, even though a lot of the music was put together earlier. I think It started off as much more of an effervescent happy, just earnest song, and then it kind of got a bit more dark but maybe deeply more sincere as well. I’m not sure.” The final version of the song was recorded by Ambrose (harmonica), Cavs (drums/percussion), Cook (piano), Joey (bass) and Stu (guitar/vocals/percussion/keyboards/bass/clarinet/organ), with Lucas nowhere to be found.

[First teased on July 13th, 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/hquwyd/honey_at_midnight/) a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADj2jDqT4uY&pp=ygURaG9uZXkgbXVzaWMgdmlkZW8%3D) directed by John Angus Stewart was released a day later which features Stu playing a modified Morris acoustic guitar in an industrial zone at sunset. In the very [first Gizzymail](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/xznn.html), Stu said “Honey was pretty funny to make. John stood really far away from me with a paparazzi style zoom lens. I had a UE Boom in my back pocket. The cops rocked up, but they were actually real nice. Maybe cos we’re two white men. Hmmm ACAB.” When the video dropped [Stu wrote this statement](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCoAD-_luvT/?img_index=3): “I wrote this song a couple of years ago. It’s nice to have it out in the world.” “Honey” would be the first taste of *K.G.* and the [first single](https://www.discogs.com/master/1845371-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Honey) for the album, which was released on November 20th, 2020. “Honey” would be the second-to-last song on the album.

The song was first played on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) as part of the fully microtonal sets the band did that year. Its debut was at the band’s first show since the COVID-19 lockdown and appeared coming out of its origin point, “Sleep Drifter,” towards the end of the set. A day later on [2021-02-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-24-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html), however, the song would be shown to be more versatile as it would appear near the beginning of the set and lead into [“Minimum Brain Size.”](https://kglw.net/song/minimum-brain-size?artist_id=1) On [2021-03-31](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-31-2021-thebarton-theatre-adelaide-australia.html) at the Thebarton Theatre in Adelaide, “Honey” was played as a standalone track with the next day ([2021-04-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-1-2021-fremantle-arts-centre-fremantle-australia.html)) having it come out of [“Nuclear Fusion.”](https://kglw.net/song/nuclear-fusion?artist_id=1) The song is a wild card throughout 2021, appearing wherever the band sees an opening, but was never one to reach longer than six minutes. In 2022 the song began to find a groove, appearing as a standalone track or next to “Sleep Drifter,” and would take a back seat as the band reintroduced their non-microtonal output. There would be some oddities such as [“Automation”](https://kglw.net/song/automation?artist_id=1) > “Honey,” as heard at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on [2022-10-10](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-10-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html), but it seemed that the song was finding a suitable place. The notable thing about 2022 versions, however, is that the song began to expand into more jammy territories, with some versions reaching nearly ten minutes in length, a feature that would remain going forward. Going into 2023 the song was played a fair amount with some notably unique transitions.

The Hungry Wolf of Fate
At the end of [K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg) is a plodding and ominous track titled [“The Hungry Wolf of Fate.”](https://kglw.net/discography/kg) The song features a tritone at its core, similar to Black Sabbath’s [namesake song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath_(song)), and is drenched in fuzz and wah wah with a nihilistic lyrical tone that asks if we’re willing to throw the world away to a grizzly fate. It even references two environmentally conscious songs during its chorus ([“Sense”](https://kglw.net/song/sense?artist_id=1) and [“Self-Immolate”](https://kglw.net/song/self-immolate?artist_id=1)). The track plays a pivotal role in leading *K.G.* into *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)* through a quick transition through the sound of wind and mirrors that album’s metal closer, [“K.G.L.W. (Outro).”](https://kglw.net/song/kglw-outro?artist_id=1) The song has only been played a handful of times, all in the year 2021 and only in Australia. The song seems like a prime candidate for the band’s sets, yet for some reason it never made it past April of 2021. It wasn’t even part of the band’s [(unfortunately canceled) metal night](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/nl6slt/king_gizzard_is_coming_to_carriageworks_sydney/) in August of that year. It seems that the fate of this song was a bit cruel.

The potential starting point was in a [Flightless Instagram stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZORkyXKy00) back in 2018. At 4:36, Stu is heard playing the tritone riff in the same rhythm as “The Hungry Wolf of Fate.” In the following years the band began to develop the song proper. Two demos for the song have been shared. The first (released on *[Demos Vol. 3: Music To Eat Pond Scum To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-3)*) features the usual intro but lunges into a verse that’s in a different key (F# rather than C#) and skips over the breaks and the song’s chorus until 1:16, which ends with a different “build-up” section. The second demo (released on *[Demos Vol. 5: Music To Think Existentially To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-5-music-to-think-existentially-to)*) is closer to the final version with the main riff and verse in the right key and the added harmonics and the structure of the final song mostly in place. The only major difference is the lack of outro. [Cavs stated](https://consequence.net/2020/11/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-kg-track-by-track/) that the song was almost cut due to the track not feeling right because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “This track almost didn’t make the cut as there was concern that it sounded too Sabbathy… I’ve always wanted to use the [‘Schools Out for Summer’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School%27s_Out_(song)) [sic] floor-tom roll in a song, so there it is… kinda. Not being able to jam as a band and record live meant that we were restricted to our home studios making this one quite tricky to record and capture the overall feel. But after many takes and iterations, this stoner doom number became one of my personal faves and will probably be a lot better live…” The studio version was recorded by Cavs (drums), Cook (synthesizer/guitar), Lucas (bass) and Stu (vocals/guitar/percussion/bass) and first heard as part of *K.G.*, released on November 20th, 2020.

The song live debuted on [2021-03-31](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-31-2021-thebarton-theatre-adelaide-australia.html) at the Thebarton Theatre in Adelaide as the second to last song of the set before its other album counterpart. The song’s live appearances don’t stray far from what’s heard on the album though they tend to be faster. “The Hungry Wolf of Fate” was last played on [2021-04-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-24-2021-meadow-music-festival-bambra-vic-australia.html) at the Meadow Music Festival in Bambra, Victoria, this time during the middle of the set rather than at the end.

L.W.
If Not Now, Then When?
The 2019-2020 Australian Bushfire Season, referred to as the Black Summer, was one of the most catastrophic environmental events in Australian history. [From its start in June until the spring of 2020](https://knowledge.aidr.org.au/resources/black-summer-bushfires-nsw-2019-20/), the fires burnt millions of acres of land leading to the deaths/displacement of three billion animals. Alongside this, the Black Summer took numerous homes and farms as well as the lives of thirty three people. 2019 was Australia’s driest year on record, paired with intense heat and these were perfect conditions for massive, powerful bushfires. When it was all done, researchers found that the fires had [significantly damaged the ozone layer](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-26/black-summer-bushfires-caused-ozone-hole/101376644), and statistics showed that [one in ten children affected were Indigenous](https://theconversation.com/1-in-10-children-affected-by-bushfires-is-indigenous-weve-been-ignoring-them-for-too-long-135212). In the wake of the fires and disgusted by the inaction of politicians and world leaders in the face of climate change, [Stu wrote](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/king-gizzard-&-the-lizard-wizard-win-environmental-music-prize/13931798) “If Not Now, Then When?”  
"After [that] shit started to feel dire. It still feels dire — more dire. We need actual, real, tangible action from our leaders, otherwise what are they there for? Why are we not doing everything we humanly can to right our wrongs? When we’re literally on fire, why not now? If not now, then when? This song is part of a larger idea, a thread and a collection of narratives that extend through all of our music. Exploring themes of climate destruction and what that might look like, is an important exploration for us. A window of what reality could be, if we fail to take real action.”  
The song is a funky microtonal tune with a loud, distorted intro that ties *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)* to its sister album *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)*. Stu sings about the state of the world (environmentally and otherwise) through a variety of statements like “when the ocean’s coming up” and “when my phone is spying me” followed by the call of action heard in its title. The chorus declares an emergency for the state of the world and says that we need to start working on things now before they get much worse.


Based on a [social media post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CInj9A9l5s2/), we know that “If Not Now, Then When” was written before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the song itself was recorded in lockdown. The creation of the song was documented on the [Tape Notes Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODI0x2unT2Q). In episode sixty four Stu plays a very rough acoustic demo of the song’s melody (the only demo for the song that exists according to him) and said: “In my mind, I thought there was a song in that and usually I would have been excited and come to the band, or at least Cavs, the drummer, and said ‘let’s jam this idea, like I’ve got this idea’ and we’d spend time workshopping it until, that kind of thing. But this time I couldn’t do that. It was just like, I had this idea and these kinds of sounds and textures and stuff in my head and it was just kind of about, like, putting it together in a way that I felt comfortable to give it to the other guys to share. Because I can’t pass that around. It’s like ‘what the fuck is that dude?’”  
From there the loose clavinet part came into being as well as a drum machine. Stu then pieced together the melody from the guitar demo onto keys. Around this stage, he showed it to the band who then began to add parts such as Cavs’ drums which were double tracked. These were laid on top of the drum machine heard before — now spliced. The song’s large intro is based on two acoustic guitar parts heavily distorted. Unlike typical Gizzard songs, there is only one vocal track on the song which was compiled using various takes by Stu. There’s also very little bass in the track as the tune was left “open” by Stu. The final studio version of the song features Ambrose (harmonica), Cavs (drums), Cook (synthesizer/vibraphone), Lucas (bass) and Stu (guitar/drums/vocals/clavinet/Wurlitzer/keyboard/sitar/percussion/synthesizer). It was recorded by Stu and Cavs with the final mix done by Stu alone. “If Not Now, Then When?” was released as the opener of *L.W.* on February 26th, 2021.


During the band’s [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6l5ub/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Joey teased a new song, calling it “monophonic ringtone style funk.” On December 8th, 2020 the band [uploaded a photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIjQmDRlEfF/) of a new music video alongside dates and times for its release. The following day they posted [another screenshot](https://www.instagram.com/p/CImBDgHFtVV/) with one final [teaser](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIm9fPdlQgy/) the day after. A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntbNRUycbD4) for the song was released on December 10th alongside a [single](https://www.discogs.com/master/1868232-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-If-Not-Now-Then-When) — making it the first taste of the then unannounced *L.W.*.  Directed by Dr D Foothead with character designs by Célia Marquis and animation by Jackie Snyder, the video depicts a woman leaving a King Gizzard show to smoke before accidentally stumbling onto an abandoned radio station where she finds a strange item that had fallen from the sky. While looking at it, a black hole appears in her chest, she puls it out of her self and things begin to be drawn into the hole. As more things are taken in, the black hole gets larger and more powerful. She tries to get rid of it but it doesn’t stop growing until it absorbs the universe before finally taking her in. Dr D Foothead described the video’s inspiration in [Gizzymail 8](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/0li4.html). “The song made me consider how individual action or inaction affects the world. What happens when our repressed pain, darkness and confusion manifest and influence our surroundings and relationships? I wanted to explore the journey of a character who has neglected their inner shadow, and how this energy manifests physically and becomes a force of its own.”  
Various behind the scenes material was included in [Gizzymail 9](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/0pi3.html). Not only is the video one of the band’s most popular (with the most views of any video on the band’s YouTube channel as of writing) it also went on to [win the inaugural Environmental Music Prize](https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/king-gizzard-&-the-lizard-wizard-win-environmental-music-prize/13931798) in June of 2021. While the band won $20,000 as a reward for the video, they decided to donate all of the money to [The Wilderness Society](https://www.wilderness.org.au/).  
On December 13th the band uploaded *[“IF NOT NOW, THEN WHEN” DJ MIX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2zE2PL79u8)*, a video showing Joey remixing the song and dancing to it.


“If Not Now, Then When?” saw a live debut on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) during the band’s first show since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. It would appear two other times that year for the band’s fully microtonal shows, with a final performance on [2021-04-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-22-2021-enmore-theatre-eora-sydney-australia.html) at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney. Since then, the song has not been played. 
O.N.E.
“O.N.E.” (pronounced “one night everywhere”) is a microtonal rock song that reflects on humanity’s effects on the natural world and the seemingly unending stream of bad news that comes with modern life. It describes the process of someone waking up, knowing that they’ll soon hear some horrific new information. They proceed to read about the world for hours while feeling like they’re going insane, but they argue that maybe humanity deserves this torture for killing all different animals on Earth for our own desires.  
Despite the song’s dark and helpless lyrics, “O.N.E.” is a colorful rock song. It starts with a slow section led by keyboard, chimes and calm vocals from Stu, before leading into a distorted and driving track with sitar, flute and other unique instrumentation.


The band released a demo of the song on *[Demos Vol. 5: Music To Think Existentially To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-5-music-to-think-existentially-to)*. This version is a quiet, keyboard-only version of the song’s intro with a different chord progression than the studio version. The final studio version was played by Ambrose (vocals/percussion/harmonica/keyboards), Cavs (drums/percussion), Cook (guitar/synthesizer), Joey (guitar) and Stu (vocals/guitar/bass/electric piano/Wurlitzer/flute/marimba/synthesizer/sitar). It was recorded and mixed by Stu, and co-recorded by Cavs. It was released as the second song on *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)* on February 26th. 2021.


On January 18th, 2021, the band [uploaded](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKNsCazF0fn/) a still of a claymation Joey playing guitar. The following day a [photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKPjFT0lBHt/) of Ambrose playing percussion on paper was posted. On the 26th the band [announced](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKhhtP0Fp05/) a new song and gave dates and times for its drop. Alex McLaren’s [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkZd2lBQb2c) for “O.N.E.” would be released on January 28th, 2021 alongside a [single](https://www.discogs.com/master/1947289-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-ONE). The video is constantly panning past various scenes with the band performing the song over the footage. and makes use of mystimation, claymation and footage shot by Ambrose during lockdown. [McLaren said](https://www.nme.com/news/music/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-share-new-microtonal-single-o-n-e-2867304) “I felt the mix of stop motion and collage through the use of found imagery and the band would help compliment the tracks lyrics and themes as I interpreted them, of dreams, nightmares, climate change, dystopias, and utopias, as well as referencing events that took place during the making of the video over 2020.” This was McLaren’s first time working for the band and he would return for [“Kepler-22b”](https://kglw.net/song/kepler-22b?artist_id=1) a year later.


“O.N.E.” made its live debut on [2021-02-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-24-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) and would be played at many of that year’s microtonal shows. The song was played alone but also saw use in jams, such as on [2021-02-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-26-2021-sidney-myer-music-bowl-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) where the song connects to [“Ontology.”](https://kglw.net/song/ontology?artist_id=1) This practice continued into 2022 where the song was in the band’s regular repertoire, sometimes gaining the intro of [“Straws in the Wind”](https://kglw.net/song/straws-in-the-wind?artist_id=1) rather than its typical slow burn. By 2023 the song had become less common but was still in the band’s lineup.
Pleura
Pleuras are [membranes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519048/) surrounding our lungs to hold pleural fluid, a substance that allows us to breathe easily and to our best ability. The song “Pleura” is the first of two Joey-led songs on [L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw) and it comments on the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic by world leaders, in this case focusing on former United States president Donald Trump. Joey depicts the spread of misinformation by Trump to his followers through cult-like language, that portrays the infection of COVID as a test of dedication to their political messiah. The debacle is reduced down to being about rights or bodily autonomy for the followers, with the line from the final verse: “I exercise my right to die.”  
The lyrics also present the death as in service of ‘the necromancer’ — a vague figure who may represent pharmaceutical companies who [make record profits](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/31/the-covid-pandemic-drives-pfizers-2022-revenue-to-a-record-100-billion.html), or those within the propaganda machine who are given new statistics to play with, thereby being able to influence the followers more.  
Musically the song is built on an odd time signature, alternating between bars of 7/8 and 8/8; and is heavier than anything thus far on the album, though this is balanced out with calm sequences with flute and whispery vocals from Stu.


The first connection to the song was established in July of 2020, when Joey (under his solo project Bullant) released the single for [“German People.”](https://bullant.bandcamp.com/album/german-people) The b-side to the song was titled “Orange Baby,” a phrase used in the lyrics of “Pleura.”  
Two demos of the “Pleura” have been made available. The first was put on *[Demos Vol. 5: Music To Think Existentially To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-5-music-to-think-existentially-to)* and is a slower but more compact version of the song. It’s entirely instrumental with a shorter intro, and added intro sections throughout that do not appear on the final version. The second demo from *[Demos Vol. 6: Music To Burn Money To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-6-music-to-burn-money-to)* is shorter, features the same intro heard in the first demo, and shifts the first chorus section into the “necromancer” section. This demo features the final song’s bridge, unlike the first demo. The studio version was played by Ambrose (harmonica/percussion), Cavs (drums), Joey (vocals/guitar/synthesizer) and Stu (guitar/bass/flute/vibraphone/vocals/organ). It was recorded by Stu and Cavs, and mixed by Stu and Joey. It was released as the second song on *L.W.* on February 26th. 2021.


In January of 2021 the band sent out their [tenth Gizzymail newsletter](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/0osu.html). While it mostly discussed bootleg releases, it contained a photo of Ambrose with no eyebrows and what looked to be a new face. The caption read “Our boy amby got a face transplant, thoughts?” On February 1st the band [uploaded a low resolution photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKvXkLzlVO8/) of Joey wearing a clear plastic face mask with the caption “Bradley Jr” to their Instagram page, followed by a [photo of Ambrose with a similar appearance](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKxa71AFscE/) captioned “Hambrose.” On February 6th [another post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CK-cLX1lE8V/?igshid=18lzisltdv4yw) featured a new picture of Cook with the caption “Pipe-Craig.” Four days later they [uploaded three images](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLG10m-lf3k/?igshid=d066qtet4mp4&img_index=3) featuring Cavs, Stu and Lucas with the same look.  On the 17th there was [a final Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLaSPsqFwRJ/?igshid=ojjke0b8tbfo), this time a video of the band in their studio getting ready to shoot a video, without anything obscuring their faces. The caption read “Making a music video today. it’s coming out tonight.” The [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPJm7lYMjJs) for “Pleura” directed by John Angus Stewart would be released that night alongside a [single](https://www.discogs.com/master/1986742-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Pleura) and the [announcement](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/posts/307098090776494?ref=embed_post) of *L.W.*.  
The images of the band from the 1st, 6th and 10th were cropped images from the single’s cover while the video showed the band performing the song in the studio with a camera on each member. In [Gizzymail 12](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/0hno.html?hl=en), Stu wrote “This was honestly a massive challenge and really fun and funny. We filmed / recorded / edited / mixed / mastered / uploaded / released this in 24 hours hahaha.”  
While never confirmed, there’s been some speculation regarding the masks. Based on the fact that the previous *L.W.* singles had covers with art taken from their respective music videos, it seems that “Pleura” originally had a completely different video featuring the band in front of a green screen post-face transplant. [A print featuring shots of the music video](https://phcfilms.com/store) was sold by PHC Films in late 2021.


“Pleura” was first played at the band’s first post-lockdown show on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne), and saw performances at seven other microtonal shows that year. It returned in 2022 and has remained in their roster since. Typically, the song is played as a standalone track and remains close to the studio version.
Supreme Ascendancy
Written by Ambrose and Stu, “Supreme Ascendancy” comments on the lack of accountability towards organized religion, specifically the Catholic Church. Ambrose sings about how, despite being caught for numerous heinous crimes, religious leaders are continuously let off the hook due to their power and importance to religion and the public. He also calls out the tax exempt status of the church, and the hypocrisy of their teachings in the face of so many offenses, going as far as to say that Satan himself hides among the priests. The lyrics tear down the idea of “supreme ascendancy” by saying that nobody, regardless of belief, is above the law.  
The song features a distinct 5/4 rhythm played by Cavs that the band riffs over to create one of the hardest rocking songs on *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)*. 


The song was performed by Ambrose (vocals/percussion/organ/keyboards/piano), Cavs (drums) and Stu (guitar/bass/vocals/sitar) with Ambrose playing the most parts out of anyone. He also co-recorded the song with Stu and Cavs (who did most of the recording for *L.W.*), and it was mixed by Stu. It was released as the second song on *L.W.* on February 26th 2021.


“Supreme Ascendancy” made its live debut during their first post-lockdown show on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), and would be played at four other fully microtonal shows that year. The song came back in 2022 as a semi-regular standalone microtonal song. Only two shows saw it as a part of a longer jam: those being [2022-05-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-4-2022-showcenter-complex-san-pedro-garza-garcia-mexico.html) and [2022-10-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-24-2022-rabbit-rabbit-asheville-nc-usa.html). The song was played even less in 2023, with only two performances the entire year.
Static Electricity
“Static Electricity” is one of the longest tracks on *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)*, with some of the most energetic moments on the album. It describes someone being split apart to create a new, mechanical form, but it also describes how humanity has gone a separate path than the rest of Earth’s living creatures toward our own undoing through technology.  
The digitization of humanity and the concept of out of control technology has been a long-running theme within the band’s work, such as on [“Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe”](https://kglw.net/discography/murder-of-the-universe), and [“Automation”](https://kglw.net/song/automation?artist_id=1), “Static Electricity” continues this theme,, with a step back to view our evolution as a whole. The song is reminiscent of the first volume of microtonal music (*L.W.* is volume 3 and more stylistically diverse), *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)*, with steady motorik beats; these are evolved through the notable use of time signatures, Ambrose’s powerful backing vocals, and the use of acoustic guitars.


The weirdo swarm knew of the song since it was [found](https://x.com/JonLamArt/status/1742906363586687289?s=20) in the ASCAP ACE Repertory in 2020 alongside *[Made In Timeland](https://kglw.net/discography/made-in-timeland)*’s [“Timeland”](https://kglw.net/song/timeland?artist_id=1), and [“Smoke and Mirrors.”](https://kglw.net/song/smoke-and-mirrors?artist_id=1) It was written by Stu and Ambrose, and played by only Amby (vocals/percussion), Cavs (drums/percussion) and Stu (guitar/vocals/synthesizer/keyboards/bass). The track was recorded by Cavs and Stu with Stu making the final mix. “Static Electricity” was released as the second song on *L.W.* on February 26th. 2021.


The song made its live debut on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at The Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) during their first post-lockdown show. It would return for five other fully microtonal shows that year. Following these shows, “Static Electricity” was played heavily throughout 2022 as a standalone song, though [2022-05-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-15-2022-guanamor-teatro-estudio-zapopan-jal-mexico.html) and [2022-10-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-14-2022-palace-theatre-st-paul-mn-usa.html) saw the song lead into [“East West Link”](https://kglw.net/song/east-west-link?artist_id=1) like it did on *L.W.*. The song saw several performances in 2023, but has become less common over time.
East West Link
For decades, the concept of the East West Link has been shrouded in controversy. The proposal is meant to link two Melbourne roads (the Eastern Freeway and the Western Ring Road) through an [eighteen kilometer tollway](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/east-west-link-project?section=#31698--1-background) to [alleviate congestion](https://roadsaustralia.weebly.com/east-west-link.html). However the project has been stalled due to a number of factors including [legal issues](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/feb/11/east-west-link-developers-sue-victorian-government-over-halted-road-project) and opposition by a number of groups who see it as a multi-billion dollar project that’s money could go to public transport, that destroys land, and may not even work. Despite being about Melbourne’s proposal, the song “East West Link” comments on humanity’s dedication to road travel and infrastructure over the environment and the attitudes of those supporting the destruction — arguing that it’s fine because nobody will see the harm they’ve caused. It's a largely acoustic track that starts with flourishes of guitar, harmonica and percussion before heading into a highly rhythmic jam which introduces sitar and double bass.


The studio version was played by Ambrose (percussion/keyboards/harmonica), Cavs (drums/percussion), Cook (piano/synthesizer/double bass) and Stu (vocals/guitar/bass/flute/sitar). The song was recorded by Stu and Cavs. Mixing sessions for the song were included in *[KG LW MIX SESH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVV9Kjd10hA)*. Stu is credited for the final mix. It was released as the second song on *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)* on February 26th. 2021.


“East West Link” made it’s live debut on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) during the band’s first post-lockdown show. It would then be played at five other fully microtonal shows in 2021. The song would return for a few performances on the band’s 2022 US tour with some coming out of [“Static Electricity”](https://kglw.net/song/static-electricity?artist_id=1) like on *L.W.*. It got even rarer in 2023 with only one performance on [2023-03-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-16-2023-x-tra-zrich-switzerland.html). 
Ataraxia
The word ataraxia [describes](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/202006/what-is-ataraxia) a state of tranquility freed from trouble or stress. The song “Ataraxia” is led by Joey with a number of strange time signatures and polymeters, and is the only song on *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)* to feature a sole songwriting credit for Joey. The song is a lament about his self doubt and diffidence being a barrier to inner peace, he tries his best to achieve it anyway by lowering the bar and brute forcing it. “Ataraxia” was played by Cavs (drums), Joey (vocals/guitar/bass/percussion/Elektron Digitakt) and Stu (guitar/organ/sitar/pungi/flute/bağlama), recorded by Cavs and Stu and mixed solely by Joey. It is briefly joked about at the beginning of *[KG LW MIX SESH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVV9Kjd10hA)*. It was released on February 26th, 2021.


The song made its live debut on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) and was played one other time before the release of *L.W.*, it was played six times total throughout 2021 as part of the band’s microtonal shows. It returned a handful of times in the following years during the microtonal segments, though the number of performances has decreased as the years have gone on. 
See Me
Both *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)* and *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)* were made during the COVID-19 pandemic, and “See Me” comments on those times by touching on how one may feel insignificant in the face of global lockdowns and climate change — while also feeling disillusioned by the actions and indifference of others. While the song may seem simple with only two chords, it also has a distinct lead part played on celeste: a piano-like instrument that uses its hammers to strike metal plates rather than strings. The studio version was played by Ambrose (vocals/percussion), Cavs (drums) and Stu (guitar/vocals/keyboard/celeste/bass/clarinet) only and was solely recorded and mixed by Stu. It was released on February 26th, 2021. Following *L.W.*’s release, “See Me” appeared in a quick ad for the band’s microtonal shows, as seen at the beginning of *[Live in Melbourne ‘21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X_LVeLFrA8&t=1325s)*. 


“See Me” saw a live debut on [2021-03-31](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-31-2021-thebarton-theatre-adelaide-australia.html) at the Thebarton Theatre in Adelaide. It would see three other performances during microtonal shows that year with a final appearance on [2021-12-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-21-2021-the-princess-theatre-brisbane-qld-australia.html). Since then “See Me” has not been played. Live versions of the song feature an unusual line up with Ambrose and Joey switching spots so that Joey can play the lead part.


K.G.L.W. (Outro)
“K.G.L.W.” or “K.G.L.W. (Outro)” as it is often listed, is a long, microtonal metal opus that closes the band’s third microtonal album *[L.W.](https://kglw.net/discography/lw)*. While the song’s lyrics are incredibly simple using repeated chants of the title, the music is complex, with an unusual song structure and a plethora of time changes, not to mention a unique assortment of sound effects. The song pairs with the [opening track](https://kglw.net/song/kglw-intro?artist_id=1) of *[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)*, which shares its name and its central motif, though it expands upon the idea to create the band’s longest microtonal track to date.


While talking about the intro on the [Tape Notes Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODI0x2unT2Q), Stu said this: “This was one of the last. It was the very last that came together for *K.G.*, that’s for sure. This intro was. And the record needed a theme song, it honestly was as simple as that, and the gentle kind of, like, folk song thing was what was first but as soon as I kind of got this riff down and sent it around it was something that more than one person said, like, ‘we need to do this as a doom metal version.’” In that same interview he said that it was originally short like the *K.G.* version but based around chugging riffs, though he couldn’t find that version of the song and called it “boring and pointless.” Wanting to reintroduce the motif, Stu instead opted to create a “linear” song as opposed to a typical song structure where “ideas come in and they don’t come back.” He did this by creating a sequence of time changes with Cavs, where each new riff added to the track pushed the time signature up by one. The song’s home is in 7/4 (prominently heard in the choruses) but at 1:49 we hear a chugging rhythm that Stu counts as in one. The next instrumental section is technically in 4/4, though Stu marks it as 2/4 for its syncopated rhythm. At 2:27 is a section in 3/4 which leads to 4/4 and then 5/4. The final time signature before the second chorus is in 6/4, bringing us back around to the 7/4 base. At 4:09 the band skips 8 and goes to a nasty 9/4, before an expansive 11/4 at 4:30. The heavy groove that follows is at 15, 17, 19 and 21 with a 4/4 beat to go back into the chorus. The lyrics in the song were kept simple as the track was meant to focus on, as Stu put it, “power and extremeness.” While the drum track was kept simple recording-wise, there are up to six guitar tracks and two bass tracks with added synth-bass on the final version. Stu said the intro was recorded last but the final addition was a sequence of sound effects that Joey had put together on top of the bounced track and given to Stu a day before mastering began on *L.W.*.  Included are the sounds of MRI machines, hydraulic hammers, drawbridges, chainsaws, nail guns and angle grinders. The final track was played by Ambrose (harmonica), Cavs (drums), Cook (hammer and anvil), Joey (MRI machine/hydraulic hammer/drawbridge/chainsaw/nail gun/angle grinder) and Stu (guitar/vocals/bass/synthesizer/percussion) and was recorded by Stu and Cavs. The final mix was done by Stu. In the lead up to the release of *L.W.*, the song was featured in a Jason Galea-made trailer called *[From the bowels of hell, comes L.W. (real footage)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4oRvYaj8B4)* which depicts the sculpture seen on *L.W.*’s album cover being pulled out of lava by a group of skeletons. “K.G.L.W. (Outro)” would go on to be released as the closer of *L.W.* on February 26th, 2021. A rehearsal session with Lucas was later included in the video *[Lukey’s Rig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZpMIn6GyBk&t=519s)*. 


The song made its live debut during the band’s first  post-lockdown show on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melobourne) where it appeared as the closer. It would remain a closer for the band’s fully microtonal shows that year, sometimes with spacey improvisational sections. Throughout 2022 the song was in regular rotation and was typically paired with “K.G.L.W. (Intro).” The two would work together to open and end the microtonal section of their live shows though this would end by September of that year, leaving the outro to be played on its own. In this state, the song has often appeared in its usual spot as a way to close that part of the show — though it also has shown up as an occasional opener like on [2023-02-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-25-2023-northcote-theatre-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). 
Live in Melbourne ‘21
Fury
“Fury” is one of the most unique King Gizzard songs for a number of reasons. On one hand it is incredibly rare — we’re talking about a total of two (debatably three) known performances in the band’s history. It is not the most rare (there’s a handful of songs like [“Sam Cherry’s Last Shot”](https://kglw.net/song/sam-cherrys-last-shot) that were only played once to our knowledge), but chances are you will never hear it. On the other hand, it’s weird even by Gizzard standards. This is not the first time a drum solo has been released by the band.*[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* features a track called [“Parking”](https://kglw.net/song/parking) which is an [“Open Water”](https://kglw.net/song/open-water) solo from Brussels on [2019-10-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-8-2019-ancienne-belgique-brussels-belgium.html), but “Fury” is the only one to be listed as its own composition. Its title is also a potential reference to a song from Cavs’ self-titled solo album entitled [“Fury Gong,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp6kacq6nxI&pp=ygUJZnVyeSBnb25n) which makes it a rare occurrence of the band referencing material from outside of the main King Gizzard discography. Whatever the case may be, “Fury” is an oddity.

Noting when “Fury” debuted is up for debate but here’s what we at KGLW.net believe. A drum solo opened the show on [2021-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Croxton Park Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). We do not consider this “Fury,” however, as the solo is different, containing a conga/chimes section that is missing from the other solos. Another solo was then played the next night of [2021-02-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-24-2021-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) with no congas/chimes and a new section of double bass drumming. This was done another time on [2021-02-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-26-2021-sidney-myer-music-bowl-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Naarm (Melbourne), which was recorded and released as *[Live in Melbourne ‘21](https://kglw.net/discography/live-in-melbourne-21)* on March 19th, 2021. To our understanding, these were the only performances of “Fury.” No matter how you interpret what constitutes “Fury” as a song, it was always a show opener before [“K.G.L.W. (Intro),”](https://kglw.net/song/kglw-intro), serving as an introduction to a night of microtonal experimentation.
Butterfly 3000
Yours
Starting *[Butterfly 3000](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)* is “Yours,” a bright and cheery synth-pop song about finding comfort and security in someone else. While Stu has gone on record to say that the album is written from the perspective of the Greek God Morpheus, the focus of “Yours” is up to interpretation. With allusions to [“The Wheel”](https://kglw.net/song/the-wheel?artist_id=1) as well as many lyrics describing the metamorphosis of a butterfly, the song sets up the album while giving it a place within the band’s canon.


[Stu said](https://www.nme.com/en_au/features/music-features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-live-music-butterfly-3000-album-3119874) that the band took a different approach when tackling both “Yours” and, by extension, *Butterfly 3000* as a whole. ““It needed to feel bright and welcoming and warm because we’ve made a lot of dark records. We’ve made a lot of scary ones…” In a [Stereogum interview](https://www.stereogum.com/2150545/king-gizzard-butterfly-3000/interviews/footnotes-interview/), he said “We were trying to make something that felt less pessimistic. So much of our music is pessimistic, even if it is in a fast tempo. We lean on dark textures a lot. I find it a lot more challenging to write music that’s bright. It just doesn’t come naturally to me. And I suppose that was the challenge with this record. Maybe someone else could explain why an acoustic guitar sounds emotionally brighter rather than electric. I’m not sure why that is, but it just feels more innocent.” The final version of the song features only Stu (syntesizer/vocals/Mellotron/acoustic guitar/bass/guitar/drums), Ambrose (percussion, vocals, harmonica) and Cavs (drums). On June 10th, 2021, “Yours” appeared in a *Butterfly 3000* [promotional video](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1403087625548820482?s=20) showcasing the album’s vinyl pressings. The song was released on June 11th, 2021 with a [full album video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyw5EaPg-xA&t=3s) filmed at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles released on the 24th. In the video *[Gizz with the program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hll9ZcWJeZM)*, the song can be heard in the pressing plant.

On June 7th, the band [uploaded a short teaser](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1402031621767794693?s=20) for *Butterfly 3000* featuring two orange balls and a song later titled [“Kelebek.”](https://kglw.net/song/kelebek) The orbs would later be seen in John Angus Stewarts’ [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=affQqee0YmE&pp=ygUFeW91cnM%3D) for “Yours”, released on June 14th, 2021. It features the band in blue and silver coats and jackets at a variety of locations in Melbourne (Rooftop Bar, Eureka 89, The Bottom End, Melbourne Aquarium and Panda Hot Pot). The video features a number of fast forward shots that were representative of a butterfly’s movement. This was achieved through the use of 16mm film. Stewart [explained to It’s Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-butterfly-3000-music-video-film-animation-160921) that the video was meant to be both light and dark: “I wanted to make something that on the surface felt bright and hopeful, but at its core had an inherent darkness. Like a rotten apple with a shiny skin.” The video was shot before a COVID-19 lockdown, which seemed to influence the creative process behind it. In the PHC Films book *[Book 1](https://phcfilms.com/book/phc)*, there is a photo of a filming schedule for “Yours” that shows it was originally meant to be shot in two days. Day one would have been the aquarium and time-lapse shots, while the second day would involve everything else — including shots in a museum and planetarium which were ultimately cut from the video. John Angus Stewart said “it was like eight locations in one day. So yeah, it was fun, but it was also fucking hell. Which in my opinion all shoots should be. One shot of fun topped with anxiety, and a few beers at the end. There isn’t really a bad time you can have with your best mates though.” In [Gizzymail #17](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/s101.html?m=AVQAADNNekIAAAAI3qIAAAhgPboAAAAAwQ4AAHfXABUqCQBgy980rpgnjcjmR_WV1geme8prOgAU87M&b=39c58e68&e=42c6896e&x=aGTDYjDNnGQDQYWfM2yaokRyqs1SesWN1PoztmV0Jgo), Stu wrote “was super fun to shoot (and eat) this. Thanks to Max and Euan for making this happen in a superbug world. Thanks to Ash and Maree for keeping those shots smooth. Thanks to Bella for the grade (it looks fucked). Thanks to Jamie and Tim for the dope stillssss. AND JOHN for dreaming this up!” A [print](https://phcfilms.com/store) of the music video was sold by PHC the same month it was released and it would later be featured on the Blu-Ray *Butterfly 3000: Ocular Edition*. The video would be referenced on the poster for [2022-04-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-19-2022-marquee-theatre-tempe-az-usa.html). 


“Yours” was given a single remix on the album *[Butterfly 3001](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3001)*. The “Fred P Journey Mix” is nearly twelve minutes long with delayed vocals, ambient synths and a driving bass line that the percussion builds from. It is the longest remix from the project.


The song has never been played live.
Shanghai
There’s moments in your life that change how you view things, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. Other times you may even wake up and feel like a totally new person. Somehow, overnight you shed your old skin and come to a conclusion or realization that shakes you so thoroughly that everything is different now. This is the type of event that inspired “Shanghai,” a song about an experience of getting high and transforming into a new person through that experience, like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis. “Shanghai” is such a happy tune, but actually comes from a place of darkness and band infighting. Not because of payouts or mismanagement or even personal issues, but over hot pot. The story of “Shanghai” all comes back to one night in the city that it’s named after, when a bunch of Australians got very angry about nothing.


Joey describes the incident to an interviewer in the documentary *Sleeping Monster*: “Ten white, six foot loser white men, and we had Jäger shots, and then we just went out for hot pot and just became insanely angry at each other. And, um, it's just piggish, and then, um, me and Cavs have an insane fight then Stu is trying to interject and then it just exploded from there.” After being asked by the interviewer “did Ambrose have one as well” he responds: “Ambrose had one, yeah, and Eric, yeah… Everyone, literally Jägermeister, we were arguing over nothing.” When asked how long it took to recover, Joey said “A couple… I don’t know, probably a week? But also it was fine.”
This story gives us the outline and the timeframe, showing that Eric was still in the band at this point. This narrows it down to around the date of their gig at the Modern Sky Lab on [2019-11-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-november-21-2019-modern-sky-lab-shanghai-china.html). Joey later talked about that night before a performance of the song on [2023-02-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-25-2023-northcote-theatre-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). “This song’s about a fight that we all got in in Shanghai… I wanted more Szechuan tempeh and Cavs didn’t want any and *unintelligible* this led to a fist fight. It was mainly because we had gotten fucked up on Jäger. And I got food poisoning and then Cavs got… burned, I guess.” On [2023-06-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-8-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html), Ambrose explained the origins of the track from his point of view. “We almost broke up this night. Got a little bit too *tongue click* in China.” Joey interjects, “we had too many Jägerbombs in Shanghai.” Ambrose continues: “we had hot pot and everyone was absolutely maggoted and everyone started arguing about the intensity of how spicy the hot pot was.” Stu’s recollection of the event is a lot more vague, though he explains the song itself in a [Stereogum interview](https://www.stereogum.com/2150545/king-gizzard-butterfly-3000/interviews/footnotes-interview/): “We had this one night/day in Shanghai, where we got the classic Szechuan hot pot and got really drunk and all went insane, basically. It was just a bizarre experience that makes sense to anyone who was there. But I suppose the song is also about that transformative element of travel — again, written from the perspective of becoming a butterfly or changing or having a singular experience that feels like you’re hatching from your cocoon. Shanghai felt like that to us. It was our first time there. I want to go back.” The interview confirms that the events took place in November of 2019. [Another interview](https://www.nme.com/en_au/features/music-features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-live-music-butterfly-3000-album-3119874) from December of that year says “We had actual fights with each other on the street, it was some kind of enlightening out of body experience where you, like, wake up the next morning, ‘Oh, I’ve changed, I’ve become a butterfly today’.” *[Butterfly 3000](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)* came out of attempts to make music for the concert film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* and [Stu said](https://www.nme.com/en_au/features/music-features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-live-music-butterfly-3000-album-3119874) that “Shanghai” was one of a few songs that made it clear that there was a possibility to make these electronic experiments into their own album. In fact, an [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/B75IP9Rg0RL/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) from January of 2020 shows that the lyrics “bye, bye Shanghai” were at least thought of at the time, as Lucas comments it under a photo of the band alongside Sam Joseph and Gaspard Demulemeester eating hot pot. It’s unclear if the photo was taken the day of the incident. The final version of “Shanghai” was recorded by Stu (synthesizer/vocals/acoustic guitar/bass/piano/Mellotron), Ambrose (percussion/vocals), Cavs (drums) and Cook (synthesizer). The melody would later be used in [“Interior People.”](https://kglw.net/song/interior-people) The song appeared in two promotional videos for *Butterfly 3000*. In *[Gizz goes to the zoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so4ZcTq8Z0A)*, Stu jokingly sings Ambrose’s part while taking photos for the album’s sleeve. Joey wears a shirt that says “Shanghai” throughout. It also appears in the background of the *[Gizz with the program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hll9ZcWJeZM)* vlog. “Shanghai” was released on June 11th, 2021. It appeared in a [full album video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyw5EaPg-xA&t=3s) filmed at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles on the 24th.

[“Shanghai”’s music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-01sgnVgkRc) was directed and animated by Amanda Bonaiuto and released on June 21st, 2021. It follows two men who walk and dance across a surreal landscape before being covered in butterflies at the end of the video. According to an [It’s Nice That article](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-butterfly-3000-music-video-film-animation-160921), Bonaiuto was picked by the band after Ambrose found her work on Instagram. She turned out to be a fan when they contacted her and was excited to make a video for them. The only instruction given was that the video had to include butterflies. She explained her view of the work in an interview with It’s Nice That, saying the characters are “entangled in this stressful strut, where they nearly step on each other over and over again as they move forward. Kind of like ‘shooting yourself in the foot’ or tripping over your words, and the strut doesn’t get interrupted or changed until we see the butterflies for the first time.” The ending represented rebirth in her mind. “[It’s] almost like a bad joke about overdoing it. Like, if they get swarmed and covered head-to-toe in butterflies (creating something like an exoskeleton) maybe all of their problems will go away.” Like all *Butterfly 3000* videos, it would be featured on the Blu-Ray *Butterfly 3000: Ocular Edition*.

The song would see its live debut on [2021-10-30](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-30-2021-sidney-myer-music-bowl-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) (alongside “Gaia”) at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Naarm (Melbourne) for the “Play On Victoria” music festival to celebrate the end of the COVID-19 lockdown. The 2022 versions are very close to the record with no additions at all outside of a longer, atmospheric intro. The only person playing synths here is Joey, with Cook adding piano behind him and Stu playing chords on his Yamaha.SG-2A. In 2023, however, the band would get more invested in synthesizers with Stu getting his own, leading to a new rendition of “Shanghai.” These versions are capable of getting past the ten-minute mark with a longer jam towards the end of the song and ad-libbed lyrics by Stu that Ambrose echoes, such as “throw your wings in the fire” and “let’s get real high.”

On December 6th, 2021, the band revealed the remix album *[Butterfly 3001](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3001)*. One of the first singles released would be “Shanghai Dub” by legendary Jamaican producer/engineer The Scientist. He said in a press release “I’ve always enjoyed being able to apply my dub mixing techniques to music outside of the typical ‘reggae mould’. The music of KGLW, and specifically the song ‘Shanghai’, provided me with the perfect landscape to be able to create something sonically rich and exciting for the listener. KGLW fans and dub-reggae fans, alike, will enjoy this song very much. Stu and the guys from KGLW are creative and imaginative musicians and songwriters and I thoroughly enjoyed working on the 'Shanghai' track for their *Butterfly 3000* remix project.” The album was released with a second remix of “Shanghai” by Deaton Chris Anthony, which brings the song into drum and bass territory. This remix would appear in the video *[Kick It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgZzVXImM2Y)*. The Scientist Dub was [released early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BgABhbhCNI) on December 6th, 2021 to tease *Butterfly 3001*.
Dreams
The topic of dreams has been with Gizzard for a long time, with tracks like [“Sleep Drifter”](https://kglw.net/song/sleep-drifter) and [“Sleepwalker”](https://kglw.net/song/sleepwalker) among several others which look at our own desire for escapism. It seems like something that the band can’t escape from, which is ironic considering that the band often sings about the escapism that sleep and dreams can bring. “Dreams” from *[Butterfly 3000](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)* is just that, a song with simplistic lyrics about how its narrator wants to sleep to escape the day. It ties into the album’s own narrative, which [Stu described as](https://www.stereogum.com/2150545/king-gizzard-butterfly-3000/interviews/footnotes-interview/) “written from the perspective of someone watching over you who is like the Dream God — like maybe it’s Morpheus, the Greek god of sleep.” There is some darkness to the track however, especially as it crosses into [“Blue Morpho,”](https://kglw.net/song/blue-morpho?artist_id=1) and that darkness can be understood by looking at the song’s history.


“Dreams” was one of the first songs the band came up with for the album, its origins coming from the creation of *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. “We wrote a couple of songs in major key vibes and we knew it wouldn’t work on ‘Chunky Shrapnel’, which we were putting together,” said Stu in an [NME interview](https://www.nme.com/en_au/features/music-features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-live-music-butterfly-3000-album-3119874). “We had the song ‘Dreams’, a synth pop thing that was clearly wrong for it. We just accidentally made this music that felt like it warranted its own project. And [‘Shanghai’](https://kglw.net/song/shanghai) came, then [‘Black Hot Soup’](https://kglw.net/song/black-hot-soup) and [‘Ya Love’](https://kglw.net/song/ya-love), and it felt like enough to hold a record and we should explore this concept super deeply.” Stu would say in a [Stereogum interview](https://www.stereogum.com/2150545/king-gizzard-butterfly-3000/interviews/footnotes-interview/): “The first two songs written were ‘Dreams’ and ‘Black Hot Soup,’ and lyrically, they were written independent of each other. But then it started to feel like, “Oh, hang on, this is kind of like a lyrical journey. I’m starting to see how this song is chapter three and this one is chapter eight. We just need to fill in all these gaps. And I’ve got these other ideas that are half finished, or there’s this other riff over here that maybe I can use in chapter five, or chapter two.” It all felt like a giant puzzle that needed to be arranged.” “Dreams” would be influenced by the looming COVID-19 pandemic, but instead of the usual nihilism, it was shaped into something more gentle. [Stu said](https://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/king_gizzard_the_lizard_wizards_stu_mackenzie_on_butterfly_3000_and_their_i) “I think it was because it was just such a depressing time. It felt like an escape for us and for me. It was like, I’m just going to go live in my fantasyland and make fucking synth loops for a while! So, that’s the genesis. Those early songs like ‘Dreams,’ ‘Ya Love,’ and ‘Black Hot Soup,’ those came together first. At the time, it wasn’t an album, it was like, “I’m just going to make music. I don’t know what this is yet.” But once a few started to come together, they had some mutual lyrical themes and we started to piece together this record. We wanted to lean on brighter textures because it felt right. It was also just challenging. We’ve made a lot of records that are scary. This one isn’t.” [The song’s original outro](https://www.stereogum.com/2150545/king-gizzard-butterfly-3000/interviews/footnotes-interview/) would become the basis for “Blue Morpho,” the next track on *Butterfly 3000*. The final version of the song was recorded by Stu (synthesizer/vocals/Mellotron/bass), Ambrose (percussion) and Cavs (drums) and would appear on *Butterfly 3000*, released on June 11th, 2021 and appeared in a [full album video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyw5EaPg-xA&t=3s) filmed at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles released on the 24th. In its final form the song would reference the *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)* song [“The Castle in the Air”](https://kglw.net/song/the-castle-in-the-air) within its lyrics.

The [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN-Sr6nPqNo) for “Dreams” was published on June 28th, 2021. It was the first of two directed and animated by Jamie Wolfe, the other being “Blue Morpho.” The video contains a number of surreal, constantly moving and hard to describe scenes that, according to an [It’s Nice That article](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-butterfly-3000-music-video-film-animation-160921), were built on various dreams from Wolfe and the people around her with additional inspiration from the Popeye cartoon *[A Dream Walking](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025071/)* and Sigmund Freud’s *[The Interpretation of Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interpretation_of_Dreams)*. Like all *Butterfly 3000* videos, it would be featured on the Blu-Ray *Butterfly 3000: Ocular Edition*. 


“Dreams” would be reinterpreted twice on *[Butterly 3001](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3001)*, the band’s remix album. The first was the Yu Su instrumental remix which is a slower, more atmospheric version of the song that builds into a frenzy by the end. The other version of the song is the “Peaking Lights Trancedellic Macrodosing Mix” which features a heavy bassline and some very catchy percussion parts before shifting to a fluttery synthscape by the halfway point.


The song has never been played live.
Blue Morpho
Bringing about the sounds of *Amnesiac*-era Radiohead (“Pyramid Song” and “Like Spinning Plates” come to mind), “Blue Morpho” is a dark but dreamlike song that takes its name from the Morpho menelaus ‘blue morpho’ butterfly species. The song follows someone in a dream ascending and transforming to the call of Morpheus, the Greek god of sleep. The song has a few connections to other pieces of the band’s discography. It mentions anamnesis, the process of remembering events and details of your past life — referenced both in the [song of the same name](https://kglw.net/song/anamnesis) from *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*, as well as [“Magenta Mountain”](https://kglw.net/song/magenta-mountain?artist_id=1) from *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)*. It also contains the phrase “moonless night,” first heard on [“The Acrid Corpse.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-acrid-corpse) 


The [Menelaus blue morpho](https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/species/blue-morpho-butterfly/) came to Stu’s attention while on a trip to Central America. In an [interview with Stereogum](https://www.stereogum.com/2150545/king-gizzard-butterfly-3000/interviews/footnotes-interview/), he said, “the blue morpho is a giant blue butterfly. I came across them in Nicaragua and they were just majestic and felt like they had power and agency over their place in the world. They’re very easy to draw a metaphor from — their life is insanely bizarre and beautiful and short. And then it’s over. I think the blue morpho represents a lot of things on this record. It felt very fitting that this blue butterfly was going to reign over this record and be the motif.” The song was originally just the outro of “Dreams,” however, it was stretched out into its own track after Stu saw potential in it. In that same article he said, “it was a short instrumental, maybe like a minute long. ‘Dreams’ faded out and this was the reprise, but from another perspective, I suppose. From a conceptual point of view, I was trying to make it sound like you’re going into your dream. After singing ‘I want to wake up in my dream,’ now I’m actually going into the dream. But it was one of those moments where the feedback from all the other guys in the band was like, ‘Nah, that’s its own thing, that’s a song!’ So it was really just about stretching it out and letting it go in different ways in different places, and letting it be its own thing.” The song was recorded by Stu (synthesizer/vocals/Mellotron/bass/Wurlitzer/drums/acoustic guitar), Ambrose (percussion/saxophone) and Cavs (drums), and released on June 11th, 2021 as part of *[Butterfly 3000](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)*. It later appeared in a [full album [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyw5EaPg-xA&t=3s) filmed at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles released on the 24th.

The [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4pi9COoTNk) for the song was the second done by Jamie Wolfe and directly follows her video for [“Dreams.”](https://kglw.net/song/dreams) It features a number of surreal 2D animated scenes and was commissioned at the second peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wolfe described the video in an interview with [It’s Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-butterfly-3000-music-video-film-animation-160921): “Similar to the ‘Dreams’ video, the point of each individual shot is more about the energy behind the action, as opposed to the action itself… I think my literal pitch was ‘The dreams of the dreamers in the ‘Dreams’ video’.” Like all *Butterfly 3000* videos, it would be featured on the Blu-Ray *Butterfly 3000: Ocular Edition*. 


“Blue Morpho” was remixed five times for the album *[Butterfly 3001](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3001)*. The first heard is the VRIL Remix, starting with breathy synth pads before flying into a brisk techno rendition of the song with quiet vocals and heavy drums and bass. Starting with crisp hi-hats and the melody from the end of “Dreams”, “Ciel’s Fluttering Dub” is a groovy instrumental remix that strays far from “Blue Morpho” proper. The ZANDOLI II Remix begins with the sounds of a jungle before introducing a bright rhythm accented by electric keyboard. This falls into a slower pocket by the end.
The final “Blue Morpho” remix on *Butterfly 3001* is the Mall Grab Remix and features a bouncy dancehall rhythm under Stu’s vocals. 


The song has never been played live.
Interior People
The song “Interior People” rests at the middle of *[Butterfly 3000](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)* and centers on themes of mental health, such as depression and out-of-control thoughts. A fan favorite from the album, (Lucas even [mentioned](https://exclaim.ca/music/article/king_gizzard_and_the_lizard_wizard_reflect_on_their_anxious_energy_thats_where_the_magic_is) that its one his kids’ favorite Gizzard songs), “Interior People” is an introspective and personal track with a blissful instrumental and musical callbacks to [“Shanghai.”](https://kglw.net/song/shanghai) 


“Interior People” was a product of the COVID-19 lockdowns and was a concept well before it was ever written. In an [interview with Stereogum](https://www.stereogum.com/2150545/king-gizzard-butterfly-3000/interviews/footnotes-interview/) Stu said, “I remember that Joey had this concept of interior people before the lyrics were really written. I remember talking to him about the conceptual idea of the whole record, back when there were only two or three songs put together and there wasn’t a huge amount of lyrics written. And he was like, ‘Well, I wanna write about interior people.’ And I was like, ‘That’s cool, this is how that idea fits in the record.’ I don’t know, the song just made sense to us. It didn’t feel like a crazy juxtaposition with the music. Maybe that was a purposeful thing from Joey, but it felt right to me.” When Joey had written the lyrics, Stu was actually concerned as to Joey’s wellbeing though he understood what it was. “…when I read them, I was like, ‘Are you okay?’ But he’s playing on the metamorphosis/change-of-states motif. It’s about questioning your sanity. Like, ‘Am I dreaming? Am I here? Am I real? Is this real?’” In a press release, Joey said it was “about the internal battle of questioning your own sanity, and the joy that comes in letting go and surrendering to the void.” The song was recorded by Ambrose (percussion), Cavs (drums), Joey (acoustic guitar/electric guitar/vocals/synthesizer/keyboards) and Stu (bass/synthesizer), with Joey playing a majority of the instruments. It was released on June 11th, 2021 with a [full album video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyw5EaPg-xA&t=3s) filmed at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles released on the 24th.

The [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzcWTjY3b8Q) for “Interior People” is a 2D animated cartoon by Studio Showoff and was released on July 12th, 2021. The video was described in an [It’s Nice That article](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-butterfly-3000-music-video-film-animation-160921) as a story about a world where humans have built a number of purple towers which is overtaken by caterpillar beings to be hives. The video follows the last remaining human woman and her partner — turned into a butterfly after a life-threatening injury — as they make their way to a tower so that she can become a butterfly too. Director Ivan Dixon explained the creation of the video in the previously linked press release: “The only direction from the band was to include butterflies, to tie in with the album name *Butterfly 3000*. When I listened to ‘Interior People;’ I immediately pictured something with momentum, like a wild road trip. That’s
where the idea of the protagonist riding a giant butterfly came from. The title made me
think of cocoons. Maybe our hero was trying to find a cocoon to metamorphose into a
butterfly herself? Little moments of affection between her and her butterfly could hint
at a deeper bond between them. Were they lovers? With the cocoon I really wanted to
design the kind of thing you would find in a typical Australian garden as a kid. The ones
with little sticks poking out of them. I’ve never seen those particular cocoons
represented anywhere before.” He also said that the video was inspired by the 1984 Hayao Miyasaki film *[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(film))*, the works of [Mœbius (Jean Giraud)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Giraud) and *[Heavy Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_Metal_(magazine))*. Dixon’s drawings also inspired the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L3-HOdMeuM) for [“Catching Smoke.”](https://kglw.net/song/catching-smoke?artist_id=1) Like all *Butterfly 3000* videos, it would be featured on the Blu-Ray *Butterfly 3000: Ocular Edition*. The video would also be referenced on the poster for [2022-04-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-19-2022-marquee-theatre-tempe-az-usa.html). 


The song was only remixed once for the album *Butterfly 3001*. The Confidence Man Remix features slowed down samples of the original that burst into an electro pop track.


“Interior People” has never been played live but that’s not for a lack of trying. In a [Reddit AMA from 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k75ji81/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Joey mentioned that they tried to play it but that it was too hard. [Another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k75e6u0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from Stu says “we'll see how we go in rehearsals!”
Catching Smoke
“Catching Smoke” is a hedonistic pop song with an instantly recognizable opening and lyrics based around a wide variety of drugs and the out-of-body experiences and highs that they can bring. However, the song also has a more personal side; in a press release for the song’s music video, Stu said “‘Catching Smoke’ is about chasing the feeling that’s impossible to catch. You’ll never get your hands on it, but you’re gonna try anyway…” The song has become a fan favorite from *[Butterfly 3000](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)* since release.


In an interview with [Stereogum](https://www.stereogum.com/2150545/king-gizzard-butterfly-3000/interviews/footnotes-interview/), Stu elaborated on the song’s meaning. “I think this is the most hedonistic song that we’ve ever written. In the narrative of the record, it was the one time we were allowed to do this and not feel guilty about it. And I suppose it’s just about embracing that butterfly state, and about embracing that kind of hedonistic headspace and actively seeking it. You’re moving on from ‘Interior People,’ where you’re questioning if you’re in it or not, and this song is about going there, even for one night.” The final version of the song was recorded by Ambrose (percussion/vocals), Cavs (drums), Cook (electric guitar/synthesizer), Joey (acoustic guitar/synthesizer/vocals/electric guitar/strings) and Stu (acoustic guitar/synthesizer/bass/vocals/percussion/drums/piano), making it the largest lineup on the album. The song was released on June 11th, 2021 with a [full album video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyw5EaPg-xA&t=3s) filmed at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles released on the 24th.

Danny Cohen’s [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L3-HOdMeuM) for “Catching Smoke” was released on July 26th, 2021. It shows the band (with no eyebrows) playing the song in a dark room. The band wears tan suits with Stu wearing a cocoon. Near the halfway point, Stu stands up and walks away from his piano and leaves his cocoon — turning into a butterfly. The rest of the band have also transformed,each one becoming a different bug while the room bright scenery and a number of backup dancers. The song ends with everyone dancing. “Catching Smoke” was Cohen’s first Gizzard video since [“People-Vultures”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f78_Tf4Tdk) in 2016 and was inspired by the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzcWTjY3b8Q) for [“Interior People.”](https://kglw.net/song/interior-people?artist_id=1) In the previously mentioned press release, Cohen said, “here's a clip that might feel like the past, or the future, maybe both, the present? It's set wherever you want it to be, whenever too, in a time that's everyone's. It's a story of a fleeting fleet, straying the course to inhabit their inner instinctual insect, I think. Or maybe it's precisely what it is, Sgt. Pepper's Bug's Life Matrix Band but more fun."  [Cohen said of the video’s concept](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-butterfly-3000-music-video-film-animation-160921), “I wanted to lure people in for the first half, keep it neutral and beige, make it feel like a somewhat regular performance clip to help contrast the shift halfway through this song.” The contrast between sections was no doubt helped by the work of Vy Nguyen and Emily Crosato who created the costumes and scenery scene in the second half. Stu noted that it was one of their biggest productions but one that he was happy with. “It was definitely, in some ways, the biggest production and traditional music video we’ve ever done, but in another way, it’s one of the most far-out things we’ve done. I feel like you can watch ‘Catching Smoke’ and feel like we’re taking the piss, or think it’s somehow ironic, but we actually wanted it to be genuine… That was the beauty in that one for me, just embracing that. It’s been nice that people have enjoyed it because we were just like what… are we doing… what have we become?” In a [2022 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i88ow32/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) both Stu and Lucas would name “Catching Smoke” as one of their favorite videos. Like all *Butterfly 3000* videos, it would be featured on the Blu-Ray *Butterfly 3000: Ocular Edition*. The video would be referenced on the poster for [2022-04-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-19-2022-marquee-theatre-tempe-az-usa.html). “Catching Smoke” would later appear in the behind the scenes video *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=1048s)* with Cavs, Joey and Lucas dancing to a sped-up version of the song.


For the album *[Butterfly 3001](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3001)*, “Catching Smoke” was remixed three times. The first is the “Dam-Funk Instrumental ‘Re-Freak’,” which is the song’s instrumental with a number of additional synth parts. In a [tweet](https://twitter.com/DaMFunK/status/1482434293548781569?s=20), DamFunk mentioned that this was one of his last remixes. The “4am Wack Rmx” by Hieroglyphic Relic starts with a discordant soundscape with sped-up samples of Stu’s vocals. A distorted electronic drum beat follows behind it which builds for almost twelve minutes. The album’s closer is the Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith remix and features a number of strange, often out-of-place and non-isolated clips layered about a steady rhythm.


“Catching Smoke” has never been played live.
2.02 Killer Year
One of many environmentally conscious songs by the band, “2.02 Killer Year” (pronounced two point oh two killer year) is *[Butterfly 3000’s](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)* look at the world. The song is centered on rising sea levels due to climate change, yet contrasts that subject with fun lyrics about surfing, while also alluding to The Beach Boys. While *Butterfly 3000* is a mostly happy album centered on hedonism and the happiness the world can bring, “2.02 Killer Year” showcases the opposite side of the coin — that our own ability to find happiness can numb us to the pressing issues in life that threaten our lives. You can only live ignorantly for so long. The title of the song is a reference to the significant global events of the year 2020, using a pun based on ‘kiloyear’; ie. a period of 1,000 years that is often used to denote significant events that occur across time scales of that magnitude, such as [the 4.2-kiloyear event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4.2-kiloyear_event). 


[Stu talked to NME](https://www.nme.com/en_au/features/music-features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-live-music-butterfly-3000-album-3119874) about its unique tone. “This is one of the songs on the record that does have some form of a darker side to it. I mean, there’s a lot of deeply anxious lyrics on this record but generally what we were trying to do was make something that felt good… I wanted to do a satirical thing where, y’know, I’m singing about global warming, the tides are rising. Right, let’s all go surfing!” In a [Stereogum interview](https://www.stereogum.com/2150545/king-gizzard-butterfly-3000/interviews/footnotes-interview/) he noted the song’s important placement on the album, describing it as a look outwards at the world rather than at the personal issues of the previous songs. “This is the little section of the record that starts zooming out. You’ve kind of gone inward for a while, and on [‘Catching Smoke,’](https://kglw.net/song/catching-smoke) you’re on this kind of trip, but now you start thinking about the world. Kiloyears are times in Earth’s history where there’s been climatic events or extinction events, and I suppose ‘2.02 Killer Year’ is a play on that — meaning that we’re in one right now. The song is about planet Earth being in one of those transitory states, and how spooky that is.” The song was recorded by Ambrose (percussion/vocals), Cavs (drums) and Stu (synthesizer/vocals/percussion/Mellotron) and was released on June 11th, 2021 as part of *Butterfly 3000*. It later appeared in a [full album [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyw5EaPg-xA&t=3s) filmed at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles released on the 24th.

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvLVX25-Go4) for the song, directed and designed by Sophie Koko with animation from Laser Days Studio (Jack Wedge & WIll Freudenheim), was released on August 2nd, 2021. It starts with a large butterfly laying eggs and flying off. The eggs hatch purple men wearing ties who begin to dance to the song before the video cuts to a work environment where everyone opens up suitcases. While the others pull out sandwiches, one opens the case to find tons of butterflies which fly out and scare it, leading the purple man to jump off a cliff into the void. It then cuts back to the large butterfly pollinating a flower, before showing to the purple man who jumped off the cliff — now with butterfly wings and antennae. Ambrose’s part features a green, long nosed feminine group of creatures singing the part. The video ends with many of the purple men jumping off the cliff while the rest lay on the ground with butterflies flying out of their mouths and eye sockets. According to an [It’s Nice That’s article](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-butterfly-3000-music-video-film-animation-160921) about the *Butterfly 3000* videos, Koko had never heard of the band before working with them, but said she was drawing lots of butterflies at the time of their collaboration. Drawn to the dark lyrics of the song, Koko began to work on the idea for the video and centered it around business. “Business people crack me up, I wanted them to be boneless so they would fall in a nice way, briefcases are funny, lunch is always a laugh.” She then collaborated with Laser Days Studio who brought the concepts and characters to life with real-time rendering. Like all *Butterfly 3000* videos, it would be featured on the Blu-Ray *Butterfly 3000: Ocular Edition*. 


The song would only receive one new version on the remix album *[Butterfly 3001](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3001)*. It was done by Bullant (aka Joey) and was titled “2.02 Killer Year (Bullant’s Fuck Mike Love Remix);” its title taking aim at the [controversial](https://www.vice.com/en/article/rjmmb6/mike-love-is-kind-of-an-asshole) Beach Boys member.  It’s one of the longest on the album at eight minutes in length and features distorted vocals and a jungle drum beat alongside shifting synths.


“2.02 Killer Year” has never been played live.
Black Hot Soup
“Black Hot Soup” is a smooth synth pop song with acoustic guitar riffs and a syncopated rhythm that ends on a dark, climatic build akin to songs like [“The Fourth Colour.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-fourth-colour) The song refers to two different things and connects them through wordplay. The first is hot pot — a Chinese dish that inspired much of *[Butterfly 3000](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)* (see [“Shanghai”](https://kglw.net/song/shanghai?artist_id=1)). The other, however, is the world and, ultimately, the universe at large. In a [Stereogum interview](https://www.stereogum.com/2150545/king-gizzard-butterfly-3000/interviews/footnotes-interview/), Stu said, “I guess I’m talking about the universe, and it’s just a further zoom-out. It’s like: Maybe the universe is conscious. Maybe the universe is a butterfly. Is the universe alive? Can it dream? Can it think? It’s just further zooming out on our butterfly.”

The song was one of the first songs on *Butterfly 3000* to be written as it was originally created for the film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*. In an [NME interview](https://www.nme.com/en_au/features/music-features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-live-music-butterfly-3000-album-3119874), Stu said, “we had the song [‘Dreams’](https://kglw.net/song/dreams), a synth pop thing that was clearly wrong for it. We just accidentally made this music that felt like it warranted its own project. And ‘Shanghai’ came then ‘Black Hot Soup’ and [‘Ya Love’](https://kglw.net/song/ya-love), and it felt like enough to hold a record and we should explore this concept super deeply.” The song was originally meant to be the album’s closer according to the previously mentioned Stereogum interview, but switched positions for “Ya Love” and [“Butterfly 3000.”](https://kglw.net/song/butterfly-3000) Stu said “...I didn’t want the record to end on a dark note. It just felt like a cop-out. The whole thing we were trying to achieve on this record was for it to not feel so ominous and sinister, because we’ve done that a lot of times before. The idea for the record was to keep zooming out, and for it to just feel bigger and bigger. We’re talking about planet Earth or Gaia, and then we’re talking about the universe, but it felt like maybe the nicest way to end it is to just go internal and ultra-personal: ‘I’ve been thinking about this whole idea of metamorphosis, and maybe now it’s time for me to be the butterfly.’” Recorded by Ambrose (percussion/vocals), Cavs (drums), Cookie (electric guitar/percussion/synthesizer) and Stu (synthesizer/acoustic guitar/vocals/bass/percussion), the song was released on June 11th, 2021 as part of *Butterfly 3000*. It later appeared in a [full album video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyw5EaPg-xA&t=3s) filmed at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles released on the 24th.

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daz_doXNAB4) for “Black Hot Soup” directed by Guy Tyzack was released on August 11th, 2021. It shows the band going on a quest for soup through a variety of different locations while being watched by a wizard in a blue robe (the “soup wizard” according to the poster for [2022-04-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-19-2022-marquee-theatre-tempe-az-usa.html)). The video features extensive use of green screens and datamoshing, as well as Terry Gilliam-esque cutout animation akin to the [Black Beast of Argh chase scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q2WPneqhhs) in *[Monty Python and the Holy Grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python_and_the_Holy_Grail)*. According to an [interview with It’s Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-butterfly-3000-music-video-film-animation-160921), it was originally meant to be a completely live action video shot in Great Otway National Park but had to be changed due to a COVID-19 lockdown. Instead, the band was put in front of a green screen at the band’s studio for forty-five minutes each to get a wide variety of clips for editing. When it was all done, the video was put to VHS tape to get the final result. “Black Hot Soup” makes a few references to older videos from the band. The “soup wizard” originally appeared in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC7ii3Ir-no) for [“Gamma Knife”](https://kglw.net/song/gamma-knife) and was later seen in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekXb74bUbRM) for [“Invisible Face.”](https://kglw.net/song/invisible-face) It also references the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qwdxKkmhoc) for [“Cellophane,”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane) with the wizard flying inside of a TV screen reminiscent of Stu’s voyage. Like all *Butterfly 3000* videos, it would be featured on the Blu-Ray *Butterfly 3000: Ocular Edition*.

“Black Hot Soup” was remixed only once for the album *[Butterfly 3001](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3001)* but ended up becoming the biggest single. The “DJ Shadow ‘My Own Reality’ Re-Write” features a chopped drum beat and a bouncy bassline accented by Stu’s scratched vocals — often focusing on the line “in my own reality.” On January 7th, 2022, the band uploaded a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJkbQLVeFPs) for the remix featuring John Safran dancing, drinking and doing drugs in a number of locations. The video also features John Dimoulas, who later appeared in the [live video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gm2TudHe0s) for “Magenta Mountain.” In [Gizzymail 22](http://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/1xir.html?m=AV8AABDMXvcAAAAKIvAAAAhgPboAAAAAwQ4AAHfXABUqCQBh351fDiGF-rtfQ5y9Q-RP7K9rUwAU87M&b=402776a6&e=e6365fad&x=aGTDYjDNnGQDQYWfM2yaokRyqs1SesWN1PoztmV0Jgo), Lucas wrote “Safran and Shadow crossover? Our teenage minds are still blowing…” Storyboards and cue sheets from the video were later released in *[Book 1](https://phcfilms.com/book/phc)*. A limited [12” single](https://www.discogs.com/release/25312000-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Black-Hot-Soup-DJ-Shadow-My-Own-Reality-Re-Write) for the song was released in November of 2022 with its b-side being “(etirW-eR 'ytilaeR nwO yM' wodahS JD) puoS toH kcalB” — a reversed version of the song that requires you to play the record backwards to hear the track correctly.


“Black Hot Soup” has never been played live.
Ya Love
“Ya Love” is a simple pop song about a shared feeling of affection between two people which calls back to [“Black Hot Soup,”](https://kglw.net/song/black-hot-soup?artist_id=1) as well as sets up the [title track](https://kglw.net/song/butterfly-3000?artist_id=1) of *[Butterfly 3000](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)*. 


The origins of “Ya Love” actually predate *Butterfly 3000*, as it was originally a demo created by Cookie. Stu said in a [Stereogum interview](https://www.stereogum.com/2150545/king-gizzard-butterfly-3000/interviews/footnotes-interview/), “Cookie [AKA guitarist Cook Craig] wrote most of the musical elements, and it wasn’t meant for this record. He sent a demo to me a long time ago, before the pandemic. I instantly gravitated towards it, but I couldn’t finish it. It just didn’t feel right until we started making this record. And I thought, ‘oh yeah, there’s that Cookie song that has that nice feeling’ and has the same energy that a lot of the other songs on this record have. And we kind of reworked it to be in the same world as the other songs. There’s a polyrhythmic kind of element with the keyboards and the drums being in different time signatures, and there’s some extra-arpeggiated synths that come in. As soon as we started putting the musical elements together, it started to feel really obvious what I should sing about. I was about to have a kid and I was feeling insanely excited about that, and just feeling excited about the future. It’s just an honest track.” He also explained the song’s purpose within the album’s running order. “I guess, thematically, ‘Ya Love’ is like, ‘I’m going through this change and I’m the butterfly,’ and ‘Butterfly 3000’ is kind of like ‘It’s time for my daughter to be a butterfly and spread her wings and be free.’ That’s why there is that anxiety attached to the lyrics, because that sentiment is kind of scary. But ultimately, it’s still pretty exciting. And I think it wraps the record up in the way it was meant to.” The song was recorded by Ambrose (percussion/vocals), Cavs (drums), Cook (Mellotron/bass/synthesizer) and Stu (vocals/drums/synthesizer/acoustic guitar/bass), and is the only song on *Butterfly 3000* to feature a songwriting credit from Cook. It was released on June 11th, 2021 with a [full album video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyw5EaPg-xA&t=3s) filmed at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles released on the 24th.

On August 24th, 2021, the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbUvwyokv_E) for “Ya Love,” created by Jason Galea, was released. It features the band in multi-colored space suits on the surface of an unknown planet (possibly Mars) beside a crashed ship. They see a gator in a red robe who catches and releases a yellow butterfly. which the band chase. What follows is a string of psychedelic landscapes ranging from gators walking around mushroom towers to the band hiding in cocoons. The video features a number of references to past and (then) future music and iconography. Include in these references is a floating castle (a callback to [“The Castle In The Air”](https://kglw.net/song/the-castle-in-the-air) from *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)*) while another scene depicts the band riding a rollercoaster on a [magenta mountain](https://kglw.net/song/magenta-mountain) — a year before the release of *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)*. “Ya Love” was the first of two videos done by Galea for Butterfly 3000 (the second being the title track) and took over a year to create; starting in March of 2020 and ending in August of 2021. In an [interview with It’s Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-butterfly-3000-music-video-film-animation-160921) he called the video tedious to create but “a good experience,” noting his ability to weave together imagery that gets fans theorizing: “[it’s] fun to see the theories and sleuthing unfold, there are often visual links that come up which I hadn’t realised myself, and work pretty seamlessly.” Like all *Butterfly 3000* videos, it would be featured on the Blu-Ray *Butterfly 3000: Ocular Edition*. The video would be referenced on the poster for [2022-04-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-19-2022-marquee-theatre-tempe-az-usa.html). 


For the remix album *[Butterfly 3001](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3001)*, “Ya Love” was given three new versions. The first is the “Héctor Oaks playing w/ Fire Mix” which features heavy bass throughout and heavily edited vocals. The Flaming Lips version of the song (“Flaming Lips’ Fascinating Haircut Re-Do”) features a new song structure with easygoing acoustic guitars and bass reminiscent of [“Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshimi_Battles_the_Pink_Robots,_Pt._1) The third version is the Geneva Jacuzzi Remix and is yet again given a new structure with new instrumental breaks featuring discordant vocals and some infectious verse sections.


“Ya Love” has never been played live.
Butterfly 3000
After the intense joy of “Ya Love,” we get the closing thesis and title track of *[Butterfly 3000](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)*: a loving ending to the band’s happiest and most optimistic album, and a tribute to Stu’s newly born daughter, Araminta. The song builds a strong atmosphere using heavy reverb and echo, and lyrically features Stu listing a range of hopes for the future: from plain happiness, to overcoming ‘the system’, and gaining agency through embracing femininity.


Recounting the pandemic and the birth of his daughter to [Stereogum](https://www.stereogum.com/2150545/king-gizzard-butterfly-3000/interviews/footnotes-interview/), Stu said, “During the pandemic I’ve had times of productivity, but then also just extreme discontent — like, ‘What’s the point in doing anything?’ There’s just less stimulus input into the brain, which I think is bad for creativity, at least for me. The less I do, the more I find it hard to create stuff. So my daughter has been a nice arrow to point through this whole crazy time, and something to just reorient any negativity.” That negativity surrounding Stu was whittled away and out of that transformation came the idea for *Butterfly 3000*. In an [interview with The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/28/our-synapses-connected-king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-evolve-again), he said, “It made me reflect on how primitively, viscerally beautiful it is to be human. You have a kid, and suddenly you can’t just be cynical any more. You have to be a force for good,” while later [saying to NME](https://www.nme.com/en_au/features/music-features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-live-music-butterfly-3000-album-3119874), “I definitely felt like I was in a cocoon before Minty was born. A butterfly is just a beautifully easy, metaphorical creature with this bizarre and interesting life cycle. That was the central motif for the whole record. And we tried to use it in every song.” Araminta (nicknamed Minty) would become the focus of the title track for the album, where Stu puts all his hopes for her into one track. When asked if the lyrics of “Butterfly 3000” were the most honest he ever sang in that same interview, he said yes: “Yeah, it’s just an honest dialogue, or monologue… I guess, thematically, [‘Ya Love’](https://kglw.net/song/ya-love?artist_id=1) is like, ‘I’m going through this change and I’m the butterfly,’ and ‘Butterfly 3000’ is kind of like ‘It’s time for my daughter to be a butterfly and spread her wings and be free.’ That’s why there is that anxiety attached to the lyrics, because that sentiment is kind of scary. But ultimately, it’s still pretty exciting. And I think it wraps the record up in the way it was meant to.” The song’s melody can be heard at the beginning of “Ya Love.” The final version was recorded by Ambrose (percussion), Cavs (drums), Cook (bass/synthesizer) and Stu (vocals/synthesizer/drums/Mellotron/percussion). “Butterfly 3000” was released on June 11th, 2021. “Ya Love” later appeared in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyw5EaPg-xA&t=3s) filmed at the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles released on the 24th, as well as *[Gizz goes to the zoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so4ZcTq8Z0A)*. In the 2022 video game *[Gran Turismo 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Turismo_7)*, the song [appears](https://racingsoundtracks.com/game/gran-turismo-7) on its soundtrack and can be heard on the menu.

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf_wToMurgw) by Jason Galea was released on August 31st, 2021. It was the second video he had made for *Butterfly 3000* (the first being “Ya Love”), and was created using After Effects with editing done on a Tachyons+ unit and Roland V-8, according to an [article by It’s Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-butterfly-3000-music-video-film-animation-160921). The video is a series of digital animations featuring blocky butterflies and a multitude of 3D effects. The final shot of the video was used in a [promo video](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1400576986150363137?s=20) for the album with the song [“Mariposa”](https://kglw.net/song/mariposa) played over it. Like all *Butterfly 3000* videos, it would be featured on the Blu-Ray *Butterfly 3000: Ocular Edition*. 


“Butterfly 3000” was remixed twice for the album *[Butterfly 3001](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3001)*. The first is the Terry Tracksuit remix with discordant vocals, fast electronic bass and a frantic drum beat. “Neu Butterfly 3000 (Peaches Remix)” starts with a sparse intro built around the simple synths and vocals before leading into a bass drum heavy back half. The Peaches Remix was [released early](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ7LS2zIuKQ) on December 6th, 2021 to tease the album. In a press release she said she “wanted to make this remix sound like a
lizard. Slippery wet and scaly dry. Something that wiggles through wide open spaces…
with slits for eyeballs…. And danceable."


“Butterfly 3000” has never been played live.
Made In Timeland
Timeland
Opening up one of the band’s most divisive albums is “Timeland” — a fifteen-minute journey through different electronic sounds and styles. These varied new sounds are pulled together through the use of a constantly ticking (though tonally changing) metronome at sixty beats per minute, which the band work off of in a series of polyrhythms. Compositionally speaking, “Timeland” is one of King Gizzard’s most varied, with an array of influences they had never used before. From the start of the song to around two minutes is a cheery section with vocal harmonies opened by the sound of a door creaking. Following this is a techno section which features a name drop for the song (later reprised in [“Smoke and Mirrors”](https://kglw.net/song/smoke-and-mirrors?artist_id=1)). At 3:43 the band introduces a melody played on ocarina over the sound of wind, bringing to mind the music of ancient cultures. We then get an acid house section which actually sees the metronome ticking change from every beat to every other beat. Moving from the trippy synths, we have a baroque-inspired piece with synthesized reeds, harpsichord, and what sounds like a theremin. After this is a percussion-heavy section where Ambrose chants briefly before moving back into the acid house section heard before. The song’s intro is reprised once again, this time with Ambrose freestyling on top, which leads to the final movement where Cavs drums frantically to what appears to be the sound of a train crossing signal. “Timeland” ends with an explosion and the ticking metronome. 


Little information is out there about the creative process behind *[Made In Timeland](https://kglw.net/discography/made-in-timeland)*, but Stu gave some information in a 2022 Reddit AMA. When [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i89t1ol/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) why they used the ticking of a clock, Stu said he “needed to make intermission music. Decided to make an album out of the idea.” The intermission was to be used between the two sets of the original planned marathon shows of 2020; by the fulfillment of the long-postponed shows, sister album *[Laminated Denim](https://kglw.net/discography/laminated-denim)* was used for the intermission instead. Stu [also described](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i89rcmd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) *Timeland* as “all about vignettes. Each vignette was mostly recorded by one individual member, then brought to the band for overdubs and additional ideas. I had the task of splicing them together into a cohesive piece. Was a fun way to make music.”
In a [drum seminar at Drumtek in Northcote, Victoria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9O9b-U0nl4), Cavs stated that some of the drums on the album were recorded using an iPhone but did not specify what parts. As for things unique to “Timeland,” it's the only song on *Made In Timeland* that features Cook Craig. The final lineup of musicians would be Stu (drums/bass/guitar/keyboards/synthesizer/percussion/vocals/ocarina/Mellotron), Joey (synthesizers/percussion), Cavs (drums/percussion), Ambrose (vocals) and Cook (keyboards/synthesizer).  Fans knew of “Timeland” going all the way back to July 13th, 2020, when Reddit user [u/theres_yer_problem](https://www.reddit.com/user/theres_yer_problem/) posted [two newly registered songs to the ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/hqh1a5/so_i_went_looking_for_the_publishinglicensing/) on r/KGATLW. “Timeland” was first heard when the entire album was leaked on December 8th, 2021. The leak was confirmed to be legitimate when the band put out an [advertisement for the Timeland festival](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PE_8pTfHun0) which featured “Timeland” prominently.

After making a quick appearance in the video *[TIMELAND JUICE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3MmynEHbyE)* to promote the band’s later-canceled Timeland festival, it debuted at [The Return of Curse of Timeland festival](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) where *Made In Timeland* was first sold. The song also appeared with a countdown clock on the stage screen that played before the band’s set. That [visualizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZTsaoyunHI) was created by Jason Galea. The video itself was released on October 12th, 2022, alongside the release of *Laminated Denim*, and the digital release of *Made In Timeland*. Since The Return of the Curse of Timeland, the countdown clock has reappeared at various marathon shows.


“Timeland” has not been performed live.
Smoke and Mirrors
The second and final track of *Made In Timeland* is [“Smoke and Mirrors.”](https://kglw.net/discography/made-in-timeland) Like [“Timeland”](https://kglw.net/song/timeland?artist_id=1) before it, the song runs fifteen minutes and explores a wide variety of influences and sounds to a clock-like, sixty-beat-per-minute metronome. Starting with the sound of a gong, we are met with a grand instrumental with a prominent rhythm section featuring a Purdie Shuffle from Cavs. Following this is a breezy section with synthesized harps and distorted drums, leading to a darker section which introduces us to Ambrose's rap persona, Shrimpomaniac. Over a techno beat, he raps about someone who sees themselves above the pain and suffering of others, arguing they deserve a level of accountability. The section also seems to sample a [yell from Steve Buscemi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEuljvGB-YU&t=14s) found in the 1999 film *[Big Daddy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Daddy_(1999_film))*. An acid house section with heavy percussion and influence from Indian music (note the tabla at 6:52) follows. After that, Cavs goes into a heavy drum break with a steady bass synthesizer played overtop, as well as strange screeching synths and the sound of a whistle. We then get a slowed down reprise of the harp section from earlier, before getting a harder reprise of the techno section heard in “Timeland.” This leads to a slow, calm acoustic section which fades into the final moments of “Smoke and Mirrors.” Shrimpomaniac reappears on top of a beat sampling the Bobby Cook and the Explosions track “[Untitled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64KK1pzMCco).” Here he brings back the topic from before by targeting the “backstabber” once more. “Smoke and Mirrors” is the more popular of the two *Made In Timeland* tracks, and it’s the first Gizzard track to feature any sort of true hip-hop influence with the first use of sampling within the discography and the introduction of Shrimpomaniac.

The creation of *Made In Timeland* hasn’t really been discussed in detail but [Stu explained the artistic process in a Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i89rcmd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3): “Timeland was all about vignettes. Each vignette was mostly recorded by one individual member, then brought to the band for overdubs and additional ideas. I had the task of splicing them together into a cohesive piece. Was a fun way to make music.” [He also said](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i89t1ol/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the idea came from needing something to play during intermissions at their marathon shows. In a [drum seminar at Drumtek in Northcote, Victoria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9O9b-U0nl4), Cavs stated that some of the drums on the album were recorded using an iPhone but did not specify what parts. In the end, Stu (bass/keyboards/synthesizer/percussion/vocals/vocoder/Mellotron), Ambrose/Shrimpomaniac (vocals), Cavs (drums/percussion/synthesizer), Lucas (keyboards/synthesizer/bass/fretless bass) and Joey (synthesizers/percussion) would play on “Smoke and Mirrors.” While *Timeland* was kept under wraps by the band, the weirdo swarm had heard of the song since July 13th, 2020, when Reddit user [u/theres_yer_problem](https://www.reddit.com/user/theres_yer_problem/) posted [two newly registered songs to the ASCAP ACE Repertory]((https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/hqh1a5/so_i_went_looking_for_the_publishinglicensing/) on r/KGATLW. On December 8th, 2021, the album in its entirety was leaked online. While “Timeland” was not different from its official version, “Smoke and Mirrors” ended with a clip heard in a highly-speculated-about [Instagram story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoedbkuSnXk&t=55s) from sound engineer Nico Wilson. Fans believed this to be part of the album, though it turned out to be Ambrose’s section of the song [“Change,”](https://kglw.net/song/change) with the footage coming from the shoot for the film Sleeping Monster. The song appeared in a promotional video for the band’s ultimately postponed Timeland festival titled *[TIMELAND JUICE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3MmynEHbyE)* on December 19th, 2021. In it, Cavs and Joey drink the titular Timeland Juice and dance around to the “Timeland” reprise in an open field.

“Smoke and Mirrors” had its first official public preview at The Return of Curse of Timeland festival on [2022-03-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) where *Made In Timeland* was first sold. A [countdown clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh-NTKaPXiQ) for the song by Jason Galea played between King Gizzard’’s first and second set. It was later published on October 12th, 2022 alongside the release of *[Laminated Denim](https://kglw.net/discography/laminated-denim)*, and the digital release of *Made In Timeland*. The “Smoke and Mirrors” countdown clock features a number of references to other Galea projects. A reference to [“Cyboogie”](https://kglw.net/song/cyboogie) can be found within the countdown at 11:07, while graphics from a *[Butterfly 3000](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)* [promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APvrOGQbCzc) and the [”Butterfly 3000” music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf_wToMurgw) can be seen at 2:57. During Shrimpomaniac’s final verse, the breakdancing Ambrose 3D model from the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioqgrYorhkU&t=3s) for [“Straws in the Wind”](https://kglw.net/song/straws-in-the-wind) appears.

Satanic Slumber Party
Satanic Slumber Party Part 1 (The Chairman's Portrait)
Opening *[Satanic Slumber Party](https://kglw.net/discography/satanic-slumber-party)* is “Satanic Slumber Party Part 1 (The Chairman's Portrait)” — a quick but spooky spoken word piece about a cult-like scenario at the “University of Heaven.” While the EP is largely based on the ‘Hat Jam’ between Tropical Fuck Storm and King Gizzard in 2018, “The Chairman’s Portrait” is the only completely new piece. It was released as the second track on *Satanic Slumber Party* on March 14th, 2022 and was later included on *[Hat Jam](https://www.discogs.com/release/22932227-KGLW-TFS-Hat-Jam)* on April 11th, 2022.

The only single from Tropical Fuck Storm’s *[Satanic Slumber Party](https://kglw.net/discography/satanic-slumber-party)* was “Satanic Slumber Party Part 2 (Midnight In Sodom)” — a song about a sleepover gone horribly wrong after using a ouija board. The song name drops a number of mythical and biblical figures (Pandora, Pazuzu, Barbatos, Gomorrah, etc) and creatures (lamia) on top of a chaotic instrumental including elements of what would become [“The Dripping Tap.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-dripping-tap) It was released as the second track on *Satanic Slumber Party* on March 14th, 2022, and was later included on [Hat Jam](https://www.discogs.com/release/22932227-KGLW-TFS-Hat-Jam) on April 11th, 2022.

Fiona Kitschin described the background of the song in a press release for the EP. "King Gizz were up at our house a while ago, recording their album *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)* with Gaz.
Then after a long day recording and a few too many drinks, the Gizz guys and us all wore hats
and recorded a very long jam, which we called ʻHat Jam.ʼ Gizz took ideas from the jam and
made up a new song called ‘The Dripping Tapʼ and Tropical Fuck Storm took the ʻHat Jamʼ
recording and turned it into *Satanic Slumber Party*. Itʼs four guitars, three drummers, two
synths, bass, harmonica, electronic sax and lots of singers and silliness. Itʼs like ʻLove Shackʼ by
the B-52s except itʼs evil.” The ‘Hat Jam’ itself was released on King Gizzard’s demo releases (specifically volumes three through five) as early versions of “The Dripping Tap.” “Midnight In Sodom” is largely based on the second demo found on *[Demos Vol. 4: Music To Die To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-4)*. That said, the beginning of the third demo provides the basis for the verses. A radio edit of the song also exists and is shorter than the studio version with a fade out at the end.

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYJJxWvVgUw) for the song, directed by Nina Renee, was uploaded on March 13th, 2022. It starts in black and white and shows the members of Tropical Fuck Storm in outfits from the early 1900s around a table with a ouija board. They decide to summon a spirit with the board, which colorizes the video. Stu, Cook, Cavs, Lucas and Ambrose are then shown as ghostly figures with Joey depicted as a floating head. They proceed to haunt Tropical Fuck Storm while dancing around before turning the band into various things. Erica Dunn is turned into a teddy bear, Gareth Liddiard is given the head of a crocodile, Lauren Hammel is changed into a dog wearing a spider costume and Fiona Kitschin dances around seemingly possessed. After some footage of the ‘Hat Jam,’ we see that Tropical Fuck Storm have now become spirits just like King Gizzard and they dance and sing together.


“Satanic Slumber Party Part 2 (Midnight In Sodom)” has never been played live.
Satanic Slumber Party Part 3 (Hoof And Horn)
The longest part of *[Satanic Slumber Party](https://kglw.net/discography/satanic-slumber-party)* is “Satanic Slumber Party Part 3 (Hoof And Horn)” It’s a twelve-minute long musique concrète piece that blends elements of the ‘Hat Jam’ sessions between Tropical Fuck Storm and King Gizzard recorded in 2018. While the song is mostly original, there are a few parts taken from the jam. The echoey synths at the beginning of “Hoof And Horn” can be found in the third demo of [“The Dripping Tap”](https://kglw.net/song/the-dripping-tap) (released on *[Demos Vol. 5: Music To Think Existentially To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-5-music-to-think-existentially-to)*) alongside drumming from either the second or third demo. The end of “Hoof And Horn” features a segment from the second demo found on *[Demos Vol.4: Music To Die To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-4)*. The track was released as the third track on *Satanic Slumber Party* on March 14th, 2022, and was later included on [Hat Jam](https://www.discogs.com/release/22932227-KGLW-TFS-Hat-Jam) on April 11th, 2022.

“Satanic Slumber Party Part 3 (Hoof And Horn)” has not been played live.
Omnium Gatherum
The Dripping Tap
“The Dripping Tap” is one of those songs that embodies what King Gizzard is all about. From its debut, it joined the ranks of songs like [“Robot Stop”](https://kglw.net/song/robot-stop?artist_id=1) and [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1), tracks that define why the band is different from most. When played live, the song brings out an unparalleled energy in the fans, and even the [band members have stated](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/king_gizzard_ama_gatherum_all/) that this song is a blast to play. There is something about it that is endearing and completely captivating. Perhaps it’s the pure dopamine rush of its jams. Could it be the environmentally conscious lyrics that are both direct and catchy? Maybe it’s the changes throughout that keep us hooked. It’s worth arguing that all of the above is the correct answer. “The Dripping Tap” can’t be boiled down to a certain element — each second seems to hit just right. It’s magic. While there is one special aspect to its recording session, “The Dripping Tap” didn’t just come out of nowhere. In fact it had a pretty long history ever before it made it onto *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)*. Fans knew it all the way back in 2019, at least in its primordial state. To understand where it comes from we need to follow the water back towards the fishies.


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CWLhIZpJUAs?si=hoJyZHqLeUS7g2u8&amp;start=702" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


The first traces of “The Dripping Tap” showed up in the 2018 sessions for *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)*. The band had traveled to the rural Victorian home studio owned by Gareth Liddiard and Fiona Kitschin of the Australian Art Punk/Noise Rock band Tropical Fuck Storm, where several days of recording and jamming were hosted. Originally, the song had simply been a jam affectionately referred to as the “Hat Jam” (sometimes stylized as “Hatjam”), as the band were wearing a variety of hats while playing. The session was loud, energetic and formless — lasting over twenty minutes and containing vital riffs that would come back around. The wild pull offs from Joey and Stu, as well as the “left the tap on” motifs can be heard on the released tapes found on *Demos* *[Vol. 3](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-3), *[Vol. 4](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-4)* and *[Vol. 5](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-5-music-to-think-existentially-to)*. According to a press release featuring Fiona, the jam was a spur of the moment thing after a few too many drinks, but one that would prove to be fruitful. “Hat Jam” would be filmed, cut down, and added to the end of their short documentary *[How to gut a Fishie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWLhIZpJUAs)* by Jason Galea. Upon the release of the video, fans were already calling for the jam to be released in some form. This is evident by comments at the time, and the fact that the most viewed part of the video is around the 11:43 mark, right when the jam begins. Even in its unfinished, unmixed and highly distorted form, the song had captured an audience. Both bands involved also seemed to love the piece and would continue to workshop what they had. In a bonus feature for the concert film *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* titled “Amby,” another seed is planted. Filmed during the band’s 2019 European tour, the video shows Ambrose and Stu messing around with a keyboard. When later asked about this video in a [Reddit AMA on May 11th, 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i88m4ai/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Ambrose would state that this was the intro of “The Dripping Tap'' and that it had gone through a few iterations before settling on what was put to record. A short demo for the section (released on *[Demos Vol. 6](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-6-music-to-burn-money-to)*) features a lo-fi electronic kit, a bouncy bassline and a nice keyboard part. The only thing missing here from a compositional viewpoint is the final note of the phrase. While the jam was shrouded in mystery, Stu said that it would “kinda” be released in the future during a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6mmg0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Later down the line in [August of 2021](https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/a-tropical-fuck-storm-and-king-gizzard-collaboration-is-on-the-way-3021919), Gareth Liddiard of Tropical Fuck Storm stated that a collaboration between TFS and King Gizzard was underway and that it “got put on the backburn for a while.” Outside of this statement little was said about the collaboration. [Lucas has said](https://relix.com/articles/detail/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-a-beautiful-mind-fuzz/) that after the Melbourne pandemic lockdowns ended and the band were able to rehearse and record in the same room together again, the first thing they did was revisit this song. “We were just recording as much as we could — Melbourne’s lockdown was long, brutal and strict so we didn’t get together a lot for a very long time,” he said. “‘The Dripping Tap’ was the first thing that we did when we got together, and it made sense to us because it was this jam that we had floating around that we had never finished. It felt like something that we didn’t need to conceptualize. We didn’t need to plan and rehearse; we could just pick up our instruments, hit record and go. We recorded for hours, capturing everything and keeping the best bits. That was what felt right at the time after being not social, not together and not interacting.” Stu would say in a [SPIN article](https://www.spin.com/2022/04/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mckenzie-interview/) “It was like, shit. This song’s sweet and we need to finish it. That one was like that, but it was a newly recorded thing. It had a vibe. We didn’t know it was going to be that long.”

Recording sessions for the song appeared throughout the video *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4)*, and give some interesting insight to the song’s creation. For example, some of the fast guitar parts throughout the song were not recorded at that speed, with Stu opting to slow down the song while adjusting its pitch, playing the part, then speeding up the entire track again to complete the section (seen at 2:52). In the end Ambrose (vocals/organ/percussion/Wurlitzer/harmonica), Cavs (drums), Cook (guitar/vocals), Joey (guitar/vocals), Lucas (bass) and Stu (vocals/guitar/bass/organ/piano/percussion) would all contribute to the track. It was recorded, mixed and produced by Stu. The same month of Liddiard’s statement, Gizzard began to tease songs for a new album by [tweeting out emojis](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1426828772016197634) that fans had to decode into song titles. “The Dripping Tap” was an emoji of a tap with two water droplets under it. On [February 8th, 2022](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1491008262409691136) the band tweeted another set of similar emojis.

Reflecting its recording process fraught with pandemic restrictions, “The Dripping Tap” wouldn’t see its debut until ‘The Return of the Curse of Timeland festival’ held in Naarm (Melbourne) on [2022-3-5](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), as redemption for the canceled New Year’s Eve Timeland festival and three months of uncertainty surrounding live shows since the incomplete 2021 Brisbane residency. At the end of the first set, Ambrose stated that the next song was “about a tap that won’t stop dripping.” The band then debuted “The Dripping Tap” to the audience — making it the third live debut of the night alongside [“Magenta Mountain”](https://kglw.net/song/magenta-mountain?artist_id=1) and [“The Garden Goblin.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-garden-goblin?artist_id=1) Astute members of the weirdo swarm recognized it as the “Hat Jam”, with others noting how the song harkened back to older euphoric high-energy live jams like [“Head On/Pill”](https://kglw.net/song/head-on-pill?artist_id=1) and [“Am I In Heaven?”](https://kglw.net/song/am-i-in-heaven?artist_id=1) A few days later on March 8th, 2022, the [song was officially released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDMldn7hFZo) as the first single from their newly announced album *Omnium Gatherum*, with its runtime spanning eighteen minutes and seventeen seconds — at the time their longest studio song. In a press release for the album, Stu remarked on how the sessions felt important coming out of the COVID lockdowns and stated that Gizzard were going into their “jammy period.” As just another of King Gizzard’s experiments with format and production, the digital single version of “The Dripping Tap” was recorded from the already pressed vinyl by mastering engineer Joseph Carra with his ‘insanely high-end’ turntable setup. The band still had more surprises up their sleeve, however. On the 13th, two things were announced. First, Tropical Fuck Storm had recorded and released their own project utilizing that jam session. Titled *[Satanic Slumber Party](https://kglw.net/discography/satanic-slumber-party)*, it is a spooky three-song EP based around the original sessions with TFS doing overdubs onto the recordings. [A video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYJJxWvVgUw) for the EP’s only single, “Satanic Slumber Party: Part 2 (Midnight In Sodom),” was released the same day. Second, both band  released a compilation simply titled *Hat Jam*. The release featured both “The Dripping Tap” and *Satanic Slumber Party*, both showing off what came of the jam. *Hat Jam* was a limited edition vinyl release with only a thousand copies pressed on “Lucky Rainbow” vinyl, instantly becoming a collector’s item.

In the time following its live debut, “The Dripping Tap” has become a regular in the band’s lineup, usually serving as an opener or closer to their sets. The song’s highly improvisational structure opens the door for a lot of experimentation. The length of the jams fluctuates from show to show, ranging from nine to thirty minutes in total (see [2023-06-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-17-2023-remlinger-farms-carnation-wa-usa.html)). Like their other long jams, “The Dripping Tap” often contains teases of other songs, such as [“Hot Water”](https://kglw.net/song/hot-water?artist_id=1) ([2023-03-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-9-2023-den-gra-hal-copenhagen-denmark.html)), [“Cellophane”](https://kglw.net/song/cellophane?artist_id=1) ([2023-04-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-6-2023-the-tivoli-brisbane-qld-australia.html)) and [“Hypertension”](https://kglw.net/song/hypertension?artist_id=1) ([2023-09-03](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-3-2023-end-of-the-road-festival-salisbury-england.html)).

Magenta Mountain
“You know when you have a really weird vivid dream and it sticks with you like glue?” Ambrose wrote in an [Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CbsgVmQBPq5/). “One day I came into the studio and Stu was trying to write one of them down. He kept banging on about this paradise called Magenta Mountain that he had seen but none of us believed him. Every day since then he’s been still trying to convince us all that it’s real and one day he will. We’re gonna get there, oh yes, we’re gonna get there.” “Magenta Mountain” is the synth-led second track of the band’s twentieth album *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)*, and tells of a journey to a monolithic, paradisiacal magenta mountain in a post-apocalyptic world. While one of the travelers believes that the mountains are real, the others don’t and doubt them, only to be proven wrong in the end — at least spiritually. The lyrics directly reference [“Polygondwanaland”](https://kglw.net/song/polygondwanaland?artist_id=1), [“Anamnesis”](https://kglw.net/song/anamnesis?artist_id=1), and [“Blue Morpho”](https://kglw.net/song/blue-morpho?artist_id=1) and are sung by Stu, Joey and Ambrose. With its catchy hooks and danceable electronic instrumentation, “Magenta Mountain” has become a fan favorite which has been taken to new heights live, especially with its epic guitar solos.


According to the liner notes, the song was played by Ambrose (vocals/percussion), Cavs (drums), Cook (guitar/synthesizer), Joey (vocals/percussion/synthesizer) and Stu (vocals/guitar/synthesizer/keyboard/bass/percussion). The notes also state that, while it was mixed and produced by Stu, the song was recorded by both him and Cavs. The first mention of the song was on [August 27th, 2021](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTE00TjlBKE/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)ion a post about [Jason Galea’s video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbUvwyokv_E) for *[Butterfly 3000](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000)*’s [“Ya Love.”](https://kglw.net/song/ya-love?artist_id=1) It reads “Magenta mountain rollercoaster, shot on infrared film.” [The video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbUvwyokv_E) does indeed feature a magenta mountain with a roller coaster on it, but the reference would go unknown for some time. Sessions for the song can be found in *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=518s)*, showing Ambrose recording his high vocal parts. To tease *Omnium Gatherum* the band took to Twitter and [tweeted emojis](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1488293162951274499) that represented the song’s titles. “Magenta Mountain” was represented by a purple circle and a mountaintop. It was guessed by [@_Space_Turtle](https://x.com/_Space_Turtle/status/1488350566304653312?s=20), who posted the band’s reference for Galea’s video. The song was released as part of *Omnium Gatherum* on April 22nd, 2022.

The song debuted on [2022-3-5](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at The Return of the Curse of Timeland festival in Naarm (Melbourne), and was one of three songs to make their first appearance that day (the other two being [“The Garden Goblin”](https://kglw.net/song/the-garden-goblin?artist_id=1) and [“The Dripping Tap”](https://kglw.net/song/the-dripping-tap?artist_id=1)). [A music video of this debut performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Gm2TudHe0s) was directed, edited and filmed by John Angus Stewart and uploaded on March 29th, 2022 — featuring actor John Dimoulas as a security guard who walks the camera through the crowd. Dimoulas would also appear in the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJkbQLVeFPs) for [“Black Hot Soup (DJ Shadow 'My Own Reality' Re-Write).”](https://kglw.net/song/black-hot-soup?artist_id=1) In its live form the song isn’t too far from its album counterpart, except for one major upgrade: a massive solo at the end by Stu. When asked in a [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i89r42i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) why the solo never made it to the album, he said “We recorded the song first and the idea for a gtr solo didn’t come about til we started rehearsing for it live. I like that they’re different tho!” Since its appearance at the Timeland festival, “Magenta Mountain” has appeared reliably in the band’s live synth exploration segments.

Kepler-22b
Over six hundred light years away in the constellation Cygnus floats a planet, [twice as big as Earth and potentially made up of large oceans](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/1599/kepler-22b/), named Kepler-22b. First spotted in 2009 and confirmed in 2011, Kepler-22b has been the basis of much thought and speculation due to its environment being potentially habitable for human beings, with some considering it a potential [“Goldilocks planet”](https://www.space.com/24128-kepler-22b.html) due to being neither too hot or cold. We don’t know too much about what could live on Kepler-22b, but King Gizzard has some guesses. The song “Kepler-22b” centers on someone fascinated with space but not smart enough to make it into NASA. Instead, they create their own telescope out of junk and point it towards the Super Earth, only to find another telescope pointing back, watching them.

“Kepler-22b” is nearly entirely built out of a sample of Melbourne jazz pianist Barney McAll’s [“Yemaya One”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2xBu7P3Vvo), which was released on the 2005 album *Mother of Dreams and Secrets*. While the song is a sprawling jazz session, “Kepler-22b” takes from its opening and ending (timestamps 0:32 and 7:29). It was the result of a COVID-19 lockdown experiment regarding sampling. Stu [said in a SPIN magazine article](https://www.spin.com/2022/04/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mckenzie-interview/) “one pandemic activity we dabbled in was trying to make music out of samples. I was doing dollar bin world music LP buying. I had to not know what it was. It had to be either one dollar or two dollars, and not in English. I was trying to figure out how to cut up samples and be creative with that. Cook and Joey and myself all fiddle around with that sort of thing, and that led to making [‘Sadie Sorceress,’](https://kglw.net/song/sadie-sorceress?artist_id=1) [‘The Grim Reaper’](https://kglw.net/song/the-grim-reaper?artist_id=1) and ‘Kepler-22b.’ Those were built out of samples that were chopped out of records we’d never heard before. They were all very fresh in that way.” The one who discovered Barney McAll was Cook Craig. In a press release for the song he said, “I actually found Barney’s record at a store in New York. I hadn’t heard any of his stuff before, but remember putting it on and being blown away straight up. I remember thinking ‘damn this is literally a sampler’s dream.’ It took me a while before I actually realized he was from Melbourne too. I guess it’s funny like that, sometimes you gotta travel halfway around the world to discover an inspiring piece of music made by someone who probably lives on the same block as you.” McCall would receive a songwriting credit for his sample. The song was played by Ambrose (percussion), Cavs (drums), Cook (synthesizer/keyboards/bass/turntable) and Stu (vocals/Mellotron/percussion). Liner notes also indicate that the technical end was a shared effort and was recorded by Cook, Stu and Cavs. Stu mixed it and co-produced it with Cook. In early 2022 the band’s Twitter page teased the track listing of a new album through emojis, prompting fans to guess the song titles. “Kepler-22b” was [represented](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1488344682547531781) by a planet, the number 22 and a honey bee. Seven people guessed the song’s title, with user [@cyberbrunk](https://x.com/cyberbrunk/status/1488345731182309383?s=20) getting the first confirmation.

On April 19th, 2022, a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfvEodNPQGs) for the song by Alex McLaren and Sean McAnulty was released on YouTube featuring the band in Hawaiian shirts and a range of animation from claymation to mystimation. “Kepler-22b” was released a few days later on the band’s 20th album *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)*. In the video *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=730s)* Ambrose, Joey and Stu can be seen dancing to [“The Grim Reaper”](https://kglw.net/song/the-grim-reaper?artist_id=1) in the same outfits as the music video. On July 7th, various drawings from the video were [auctioned off](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/kepler-auction) on eBay alongside test pressings of *Omnium Gatherum*. All money raised went towards [The Wilderness Society](https://www.wilderness.org.au/).

While the song had gotten special treatment with a music video release, it was never played live (outside of a quick performance at [Cavs’ drum seminar](https://youtu.be/M9O9b-U0nl4?si=f8iCscpGMaW8Wgl_) at Drumtek in Northcote, Victoria) until [2023-8-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-22-2023-parco-della-musica-padua-italy.html) when it debuted at the Parco Della Musica in Padua, Italy. “Kepler-22b” was only played four times that year. In a live setting the song has gained a longer outro which sometimes extends into a spacier synth jam. “Kepler-22b” is unique in its live form as it is the only Gizzard song to feature any sort of live sampling, a trait not even shared by Sadie Sorceress” and “The Grim Reaper.”

Gaia
In the years following the 2019 release of *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)*, many in the weirdo swarm were begging for more metal Gizz in the immediate future. The idea to make another metal album was in the cards for King Gizzard, although [based on their words](https://www.thevinylguide.com/episodes/ep325-ambrose-kenny-smith-the-murlocs-king-gizzard?fbclid=IwAR2vEkH2yv3AIrmqoar-5PSidoLG56D7FV7p0mpndDtufBQpz2xGmrxjzzw), the follow up would have to be notably different. Fans waited in anticipation of what this new album could sound like, and on October 30th, 2021 fans heard what would be the next step for Gizzard’s metal sound. Described as using “Korn tuning” (drop B) and featuring instantly iconic riffs and winding instrumental passages, “Gaia” expands on their prior experimentation and forges ahead into new territory.

In [Cavs’ drum seminar](https://youtu.be/M9O9b-U0nl4?si=f8iCscpGMaW8Wgl_) done at Drumtek in Northcote, he said the song was one of his favorites to play because it “started from the drumbeat and then everything else came after that.” He noted that this type of development is unusual for the band. A demo for the song was released as part of *[Demos Vol. 3: Music To Eat Pond Scum To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-3)*. With a much slower pace and a drum machine beat, the instrumental demo attempts to get the main riff and idea of the song down, while also featuring what would end up being the song’s ending section. In the video *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=56s)* at 8:17, Stu is seen recording Joey’s vocals for the song while both are holding back laughter. The studio version of “Gaia” would be played by Cavs (drums), Cook (synthesizer), Joey (bass/guitar/vocals) and Stu (vocals/guitar). It was recorded, mixed and produced by Stu. The [lyrics to the track](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1454733409134133254?s=20) were shared on Halloween 2021 through the band’s Twitter page. Gizzard [teased the song](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1488430218033328131) on their Twitter page with a single globe emoji on February 1st, 2022 as part of a guessing game for *Omnium Gatherum*’s track listing. It was guessed by twenty different users, although the user [@chrastopheria](https://x.com/chrastopheria/status/1489583731920846850?s=20) got the first confirmation. “Gaia” was [added to the ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/syhm81/gaia_has_been_registered_to_ascap/) sometime that same month. In March the studio version of the song was teased in a [promo](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/t4t319/the_band_just_posted_a_snippet_of_the_studio/) for the Return of the Curse of Timeland festival and was released as part of *Omnium Gatherum* on April 22nd, 2022. While “Gaia” was never an official single for *Omnium Gatherum*, a [limited edition “Lucky Rainbow” 7” single](https://www.discogs.com/release/23299109-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Gaia-Presumptuous-) with a B-side of [“Presumptuous”](https://kglw.net/song/presumptuous?artist_id=1) was sold on tour, with leftover copies going to the Gizzverse store. Only one thousand copies were pressed. Later that year it was [repressed on “Orange Lava” vinyl](https://www.discogs.com/release/25553998-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Gaia-Presumptuous-) and sold at the Forest Hills and St. Kilda record fairs with a very low number being pressed, about fifty to one hundred total. The ending chords of “Gaia” would reappear on the *[Petrodragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)* song [“Motor Spirit”](https://kglw.net/song/motor-spirit?artist_id=1) starting at 7:25 and the word would be mentioned during the final verse of [“Flamethrower.”](https://kglw.net/song/flamethrower?artist_id=1)

“Gaia” made its live debut on [2021-10-30](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-30-2021-sidney-myer-music-bowl-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Naarm (Melbourne) as part of “Play On Victoria,” the first major concert in town since the COVID-19 lockdown. The song was played close to the studio version with no notable differences and wouldn’t be played again that year. The song returned as part of the Return of the Curse of Timeland festival on [2022-03-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), this time with an extended drum solo from Cavs, which would become a standard feature of the song moving forward. Throughout 2022 “Gaia” was in the regular rotation as a standalone track, never transitioning into any other songs. As the band began to promote *Petrodragonic Apocalypse*, however, they started to change what “Gaia” could be. On [2023-04-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-1-2023-vintage-vibes-festival-woodside-sa-australia.html) at the Vintage Vibes Festival, the band pulled out “Gaia” > [“Gila Monster”](https://kglw.net/song/gila-monster?artist_id=1) > “Gaia.” This would become a common combination in the following months. For the US residency tour the band pulled multiple “Gaia” > “Motor Spirit” > “Gaia” medleys. Some shows would see other songs added into the mix such as [2023-06-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-11-2023-the-salt-shed-chicago-il-usa.html)’s [“The Great Chain of Being”](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup) and the debut of [“Dragon”](https://kglw.net/song/dragon?artist_id=1) on [2023-08-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-16-2023-den-atelier-luxembourg-luxembourg.html). While “Gaia” would be played on its own that year, such as for Highway Holidays on [2023-03-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-1-2023-highway-holiday-studio-brussels-belgium.html), it was far more common for it to be part of a longer, seamless medley. Going into 2024 the song was again commonly paired with “Gila Monster” in the “Gaia” > “Gila Monster” > “Gaia” formation.

Ambergris
A smooth Joey-led song, “Ambergris” focuses on the sought after substance it’s named after. Ambergris is a waxy substance created within the intestines of sperm whales, [theorized to help them digest the hard beaks of squids and cuttlefish](https://www.britannica.com/science/ambergris). While often referred to as “whale vomit,” it instead is digested and excreted. Humans have used the substance to create perfume and candles, while others in the 19th century used [ambergris in meals](https://brooklynbrainery.com/blog/ambergris-is-a-weird-thing), including King Charles the II who allegedly said that eggs and ambergris were his favorite meal. Due to the whaling industry, which killed thousands of whales to try and get the substance, ambergris has been made illegal in both Australia and the United States. The song references its uses and humanity’s hunt for whales for their own desires such as the creation of whale oil, all from the perspective of a whale. It's a slow, funky song (broken by some abstract noises calling to attention the passing of ambergris through the intestines) that would become a sexy, though slightly disgusting, live song moving forward.

Recording sessions for the song appear in *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=518s)*. It first appears at 12:14 where Joey is listening back to the guitar parts. When asked what he’s working on, he says the song is entitled “Dog Sweat” before Ambrose calls the song “sexy as hell.” A quick clip from the same session appears at 13:46, where they react to the guitar lines. Liner notes indicate that Cavs (drums), Cook (synthesizer), Joey (vocals/synthesizer/percussion/guitar) and Stu (synthesizer/clavinet/organ) played on the song. While it was mixed and produced by Joey, it was co-recorded by Cavs. Unusually, credit for the song’s prominent bass work is missing, though Joey said that he played bass on the song during the band’s [2023 Reddit AMA(https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k75dm48/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). As part of a guessing game for the album’s track listing, “Ambergris” was [teased](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1488819895290646529) with an emoji of a whale followed by an emoji of a rock on February 2nd, 2022. It was [guessed](https://x.com/thomasbartz_/status/1488840214000947203?s=20) by two people that same day, although [one](https://twitter.com/earfloss/status/1488820234068709381) spelled it “Ambergrys.” The song was released on April 22nd, 2022. Lucas would go on to say that “Ambergris” is his favorite song on *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)* during a [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i88iiu1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) after its release.

The song was first played on [2022-06-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-14-2022-tempodrom-berlin-germany.html) at the Tempodrom in Berlin and would be played throughout 2022 close to the studio version, with the only notable changes being a new intro, the removal of the “farting” sounds, and Joey occasionally singing ‘Ambr-ose’ instead of the song’s title in the lyrics. It has remained in setlist rotation and is often introduced as a “sexy” song,with Ambrose referring to it as “Joey’s porno song” on [2023-03-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-9-2023-den-gra-hal-copenhagen-denmark.html).

Sadie Sorceress
An old school hip-hop-styled track about an “80’s lady named Sadie” featuring both Stu and Ambrose (aka Shrimpomaniac) rapping, “Sadie Sorceress” is the first full rap song by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. Featuring a heavy rhythm section, some light organ parts and lyrics detailing Sadie’s witch-like lifestyle through references to Harry Potter and allusions to the Salem Witch Trials, it’s one of the most unique tracks on *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)*.


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wKo34lJ4XZ4?si=W7HBo2QcxP3PBuh7&amp;start=687" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;"> 


According to [an interview with SPIN magazine](https://www.spin.com/2022/04/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mckenzie-interview/), “Sadie Sorceress” was one of a few songs that was the result of lockdown sampling. “One pandemic activity we dabbled in was trying to make music out of samples. I was doing dollar bin world music LP buying. I had to not know what it was. It had to be either one dollar or two dollars, and not in English. I was trying to figure out how to cut up samples and be creative with that. Cook and Joey and myself all fiddle around with that sort of thing, and that led to making ‘Sadie Sorceress,’ [‘The Grim Reaper’](https://kglw.net/song/the-grim-reaper?artist_id=1) and [‘Kepler-22b.’](https://kglw.net/song/kepler-22b?artist_id=1) Those were built out of samples that were chopped out of records we’d never heard before. They were all very fresh in that way.” As for the hip-hop elements of the track, he said “Amby has always had one foot in that world and has been super keen to pursue that with Gizz one day. That was making music out of samples, which is a piece of hip-hop culture. It just naturally evolved and the logical next step was to get some shrimp bars on there. It was a very natural thing.” The song features numerous vocal additions by Ambrose’s grandmother Millicent Smith. In the video *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=518s)* we get to see her record some lines for the song. [A tweet](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1517235742225080320) from the band says that she was ninety-seven at the time, though an [Instagram clip](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ccq8gYePsyq/) says she’s ninety-eight. Ambrose said on [2023-03-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-23-2023-troxy-london-england.html) that when he first showed her the song, all she said was “that’s disgusting.” That said, she seems to have embraced her role as Sadie, appearing in [Gizzymail 23](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl3/RMV3_uaVcU0kX7uIY3K66g?m=AUwAAFdlbQwAAAALhPwAAAhgPboAAAAAwQ4AAHfXABUqCQBivmHFZTRxxtF0QJqIUZj4tViSTAAU87M&b=f0223256&e=7817011d&x=aGTDYjDNnGQDQYWfM2yaokRyqs1SesWN1PoztmV0Jgo) wearing a hip beanie and posing alongside Shrimpomaniac himself. Later in *The Making of Omnium Gatherum* the band is seen listening back to the song. The intro of “Sadie Sorceress” is a sample of “Je ne suis rien sans toi” by French singer Mireille Mathieu, released in 1968. It’s a French reinterpretation of “I’m Coming Home,” a song written by John Mason and Leslie Reed which was famously sung by Tom Jones and became a hit in Europe. It seems that the band had a hard time contacting the rights holders as [they tweeted](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1482918361839587332?s=20) asking anyone to help them get in contact with Sony Music France on January 16th, 2022. Both Mason and Reed would receive a songwriting credit on “Sadie Sorceress.” In the end, Ambrose (vocals), Joey (turntable/Mellotron/synthesizer), Stu (vocals/clavinet/turntable) would be the only members of the band to play on the track. It was recorded and produced by Stu and Joey but only mixed by Stu. The band teased the songs of *Omnium Gatherum* on Twitter through emojis. [On February 2nd](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1489071425332064257), the song’s title was represented by a princess and a crystal ball. [On the 8th](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1491218374902562816?s=20) it was teased again, this time by a sad face, a plus symbol, an envelope and pair of eyes, another plus symbol, then an envelope with the letter E on it, a night sky and a sorceress. [@pixelperfect24](https://x.com/pixelperfect24/status/1491229010818629632?s=20) guessed it correctly on the 8th. The song was released as part of *Omnium Gatherum* on April 22nd, 2022.

“Sadie Sorceress” was first played on [2022-05-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-15-2022-guanamor-teatro-estudio-zapopan-jal-mexico.html) at Guanamor Teatro Estudio in Zapopan, Mexico. It was played a handful of times in 2022 and then twice in 2023, making it a rare song in the band’s live rotation. While the song is played close to the studio version minus the sample at the beginning, some performances would feature the first verse of “The Grim Reaper” towards the end of the track.

Evilest Man
Not to be mistaken with [“Evil Man”](https://kglw.net/song/evil-man?artist_id=1) from *[Eyes Like the Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)*, “Evilest Man” is about the person Stu thinks is the evilest man in the world. That person is Australian media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch owns/owned/founded a number of high profile publications such as The Wall Street Journal and The Times, a number of conservative papers such as the New York Post and The Herald Sun, tabloid papers such as The Daily Telegraph and Star, and TV channels such as Fox. His influence over society is immeasurable; in fact, it’s easy to argue that his influence has changed the trajectory of a large portion of modern politics. A look at the sway of Fox News alone makes a good case. Yet beyond the influence is a history of [less than favorable ethics](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/mar/11/jonathan-rees-private-investigator-tabloid) such as Operation Nigeria in 2002, where a Murdoch-owned publication paid large sums for illegally obtained voicemail messages. To explain his disgust, Stu wrote “Evilest Man,” a song that not just directly name drops Murdoch, but cleverly uses the various scandals and Murdoch-owned properties to make a song about the failings of modern journalism, distrust in the media and how headlines and outlets could turn us all into people like him. 


The roots of “Evilest Man” go all the way back to at least 2019 when the band was recording at Flightless HQ. In an [interview for SPIN magazine](https://www.spin.com/2022/04/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mckenzie-interview/), Stu said “‘Evilest Man’ is kind of an older one. It was actually recorded at our old studio, which we haven’t been in since 2019. After we made [Butterfly](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000), we figured out how to use analog modular synths a little bit better, and that one got more synth-heavy. It was more of a straight-ahead rock song to begin with.” The song incorporates a slowed down synth line first found in the song [“Cyboogie”](https://kglw.net/song/cyboogie?artist_id=1) from *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)*.  
Liner notes state that Ambrose (percussion/vocals), Cavs (drums), Cook (guitar), Joey (synthesizer/percussion) and Stu (vocals/guitar/lute/vibraphone/Wurlitzer/synthesizer/keyboards/vocoder/bass/percussion) all played on the track. It was recorded, mixed and produced by Stu. As part of a guessing game for the album’s track titles, “Evilest Man” was given two tweets. [The first](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1489101004474060802) on February 2nd, 2022, features a devil emoji, a newspaper emoji and a man with a mustache emoji. Days later on [the 8th](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1491229560419274752?s=20) was a new string of emojis: a devil, a first place medal, a night sky and an icon of a man. [@samtrichard15](https://x.com/samtrichard15/status/1491237099835912195?s=20) guessed the song on the 8th. The song was released as part of *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)* on April 22nd, 2022.


“Evilest Man” has not been played live but was reportedly soundchecked at one point.
The Garden Goblin
During his time with the band, Cook Craig has only had a handful of tracks to his name, yet when he does get the chance, you can be sure it will be distinct and memorable. “The Garden Goblin” is a prime example. The song is a short, whimsical track comparable to early Syd Barrett, and features a drum machine, sound effects, and unique synth parts throughout. The song ends with a short, discordant jam before leading into [“Blame It On the Weather.”](https://kglw.net/song/blame-it-on-the-weather?artist_id=1) This happy-go-lucky tune has a pretty loyal following with lots of fan art and an [attempted flash mob at Red Rocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/xdzzn9/be_ready_for_gizztober_with_the_goblin_dance_red/) in 2022. While the song is one of the shortest on the album, it sure has left an impact. 


Despite the fantasy imagery that may come to mind with the song’s title, “The Garden Goblin” is referencing [Cook’s french bulldog Homer](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/xk5s1b/breaking_kglw_posts_the_original_garden_goblin/). In an interview featured in [Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie Magazine issue five](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/t1j478/cookie_quote_about_garden_goblin_track_9_on/), Cook explained the song’s origins. “Recently I wrote a song for Gizz called ‘Garden Goblin’. It's about gardening. It’s about Homer in the garden, he looks like a bit of a goblin! He loves being out there. When he was growing up and was a puppy we lived in share houses and apartments, so we never really had a backyard. He loves when I go out there to garden, he follows me around.” Pipe-eye fans might recognize Homer from the cover of *[Inside/Outside](https://pipe-eye.bandcamp.com/album/inside-outside)* and as the potential inspiration for [“Best Friend.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbKKQnzCWMQ) While we don’t know much about the song’s recording history, at 10:35 of the behind-the-scenes video *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=882s)* Cavs is seen playing a drum part very close to the electronic beat on the finished song, implying that the song may have been recorded with a real kit at one point but was changed. The final studio version was played by only three people: Ambrose (vocals/percussion/saxophone), Cook (vocals/Mellotron/synthesizer/percussion/keyboards), Stu (vocals/percussion/synthesizer). The track was recorded by Cook and co-produced by him and Stu. The first hint of the song was in an [Instagram story](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/snnga9/track_8_is_definitely_garden_goblin_this_was_on/) which featured an image of the band (barring Cook and Joey) sitting on grass with the caption “Garden Goblins HAHAHA.” On [February 3rd, 2022](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1489417764502904833?s=20), the song was teased through emojis as part of a guessing game to figure out the album’s tracklist. The song was represented by an emoji of a house and a mask of a Tengu, a yokai found in Japanese folklore. The song was [guessed correctly](https://x.com/IsaacXirakis/status/1489542202589999109?s=20) on the 4th. It would be released as part of *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)* on April 22nd, 2022 and would be Cook’s newest Gizzard song since [“Down the Sink”](https://kglw.net/song/down-the-sink?artist_id=1) on 2017’s *[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)*.

“The Garden Goblin” debuted at the Return of the Curse of Timeland Festival in Naarm (Melbourne) on [2023-03-05](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-5-2022-reunion-park-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) alongside [“Magenta Mountain”](https://kglw.net/song/magenta-mountain?artist_id=1) and [“The Dripping Tap,”](https://kglw.net/song/the-dripping-tap?artist_id=1) making it the third song from *Omnium Gatherum* to be played live ([“Gaia”](https://kglw.net/song/gaia?artist_id=1) was first on [2021-10-30](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-30-2021-sidney-myer-music-bowl-naarm-melbourne-australia.html)). The live performance doesn’t deviate far from the studio version, outside of a real drum kit being used and a lack of sound effects and outro. It was played throughout 2022 into 2023, and while it hasn’t been played as much as “The Dripping Tap” or “Gaia,” it’s certainly not the least-played from *Omnium*, making it very common for a Cook song.

Blame It On The Weather
A simple song about looking at events around you and refusing to take accountability or responsibility, “Blame It On The Weather” is a bright song with a slightly darker lyrical edge. The song brings up ways one might try to avoid confronting the issue, from deflection to drug abuse (specifically bringing up k-holes, an out of body dissociative experience felt after a large dose of ketamine).  “Blame It On The Weather” features lead vocals from both Ambrose and Stu who trade verses while also singing harmony, as well as a slide guitar solo from Joey.

At 17:40 of *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=882s)* Joey is seen recording his slide guitar part with a battery, a move which Stu and Ambrose loved. Based on their clothing, we know that the song was being recorded the same day they apparently finished [“Candles.”](https://kglw.net/song/candles?artist_id=1) The liner notes of *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)* state that Ambrose (vocals/percussion/synthesizer/saxophone), Cavs (drums/percussion), Joey (guitar) and Stu (vocals/organ/Mellotron/percussion) performed on the song. It was mixed and produced by Stu while being recorded by Stu, Ambrose and Cavs. The song’s title was teased in a [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1489506494983061506) on February 4th, 2022. It featured emojis of an angry face, a hand pointing towards the right and a thermometer. It was guessed correctly by [@Papamanca69](https://twitter.com/Papamanca69/status/1492283704844107778?s=20) days later on the 11th. The song was released as part of *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)* on April 22nd, 2022.

A Jason Galea-filmed [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvtKmUgW2u4&t=29s) of the band rehearsing for their 2022 American tour was released on July 11th, 2022. It shows the band playing the song at the County Line recording studio with some video effects, and contains a new version of the song recorded by Sam Joseph, Nico Wilson and Gaspard De Meulemeester, with mixing done by Stu.

“Blame It On the Weather” made its live debut on [2022-03-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-7-2022-enmore-theatre-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html) at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney, returning on [2022-04-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-12-2022-fox-theater-pomona-pomona-ca-usa.html) to be played regularly throughout the year before dropping off setlists in 2023, with only one appearance on [2023-03-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-6-2023-plan-b-malmo-sweden.html). The song is typically played close to the studio version, although without the slide solo.
Persistence
“Persistence” is an exercise in innuendo. Stu’s lyrics use automotive and mechanical language to (not so subtly) describe making love. The song features a steady drum beat, a wide range of vocal parts from Stu and some easy going guitars.


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wKo34lJ4XZ4?si=tus_GAtqmcQP7TI2&amp;start=860" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


Ambrose (percussion/Mellotron), Cavs (drums), Cook (guitar/Wurlitzer/bass/synthesizer), Joey (vocals/guitar/synthesizer) and Stu all played on the track. The song also features drumming from Amy Findlay, drummer of Stonefield and Cavs’ wife. This makes her the second guest drummer on a Gizzard album, the other being Monty Harnett for [“Crying”](https://kglw.net/song/crying?artist_id=1) and [“Pipe-Dream”](https://kglw.net/song/pipe-dream?artist_id=1) on 2014’s *[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)*. Footage of her recording can be found in *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=882s)* at 10:41, as well as a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=5023978821051987) from April 24th, which states she was forty weeks pregnant when recording. Later in *The Making of Omnium Gatherum* at 14:20, Stu is seen recording his vocals and dancing to the song in the studio. “Persistence” was mixed and produced by Stu, and recorded by Stu, Cook and Cavs.  On February 6th, 2022 the song’s title was teased on the band’s Twitter page with a [number of emojis](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1490248454169575425). Putting the first letter of each icon’s name together, you get the word “persistence.” [@jnuke83](https://twitter.com/jnuke83/status/1490249611755225093?s=20) guessed the answer that same day. The song was released as part of *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)* on April 22nd, 2022.

The song debuted on [2022-04-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-27-2022-phoenix-theatre-petaluma-ca-usa.html) at the Phoenix Theatre in Petaluma, with a total runtime nearly reaching ten minutes in length, with jammier sections throughout. The band continued this trend throughout 2022, with the song making semi-regular appearances. In 2023, however, the song almost completely fell off of setlists, with only one appearance on [2023-03-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-15-2023-alcatraz-milan-italy.html).

The Grim Reaper
The second and final rap song on *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)* is “The Grim Reaper' — a song where Ambrose (aka Shrimpomaniac) raps from the perspective of the grim reaper itself, taking lives and “cashing cheques.” Built upon multiple slowed-down samples from the Heinz Funk song [“In the Orient”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5b67KNI7nc) (released on the album *[National Flavours](https://www.discogs.com/release/4027696-Kai-Martin-And-His-Sounds-National-Flavours)* by Kai Martin and His Sounds in 1974), this gruesome song has been a standard Ambrose tune since its debut with high energy and extended live jams being commonplace.

“The Grim Reaper” was the result of the band experimenting with sampling during the COVID-19 lockdown. According to [an interview with SPIN magazine](https://www.spin.com/2022/04/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mckenzie-interview/), Stu said “One pandemic activity we dabbled in was trying to make music out of samples. I was doing dollar bin world music LP buying. I had to not know what it was. It had to be either one dollar or two dollars, and not in English. I was trying to figure out how to cut up samples and be creative with that. Cook and Joey and myself all fiddle around with that sort of thing, and that led to making [‘Sadie Sorceress,’](https://kglw.net/song/sadie-sorceress?artist_id=1) ‘The Grim Reaper’ and [‘Kepler-22b.’](https://kglw.net/song/kepler-22b?artist_id=1) Those were built out of samples that were chopped out of records we’d never heard before. They were all very fresh in that way.” The hip-hop angle came from Ambrose, however. “Ambrose has always had one foot in that world and has been super keen to pursue that with Gizz one day. That was making music out of samples, which is a piece of hip-hop culture. It just naturally evolved and the logical next step was to get some shrimp bars on there. It was a very natural thing.” The band can be seen working on the song in the video *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=882s)* (starting at 19:22). It shows them working on the end of the song and cutting the synth part down to give Ambrose’s final word more space. They then jam and dance to the song while wearing Hawaiian shirts, the same ones seen in the video for “Kepler-22b.” The final track was played by Ambrose (vocals/percussion), Cavs (drums), Joey (synthesizer/bağlama) and Stu (turntable/percussion). It was mixed and produced by Stu, and recorded by Stu and Cavs. The band teased *Omnium Gatherum*’s track listing on Twitter using [different combinations of emojis](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1490449620866318341?s=20). The song was hinted at through a grimacing face, a minus sign, a microphone, a night sky, ears of rice, and a tractor. It was guessed by [@ListenerJae](https://x.com/ListenerJae/status/1491244724883435523?s=20) two days after being tweeted. It was released as part of *Omnium Gatherum* on April 22nd, 2022.

The song was first played on [2022-05-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-20-2022-agora-cleveland-oh-usa.html) at the Agora in Cleveland and would be regularly played in the following shows. Despite being built on a sample, the band plays the music live and often gives it an extended outro with extensive synth work from Joey and some additional verses from Ambrose. These range from the other *Omnium Gatherum* rap song “Sadie Sorceress,” to the Beastie Boys’ classic [“Intergalactic”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergalactic_(song)) (see [2023-06-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-21-2023-hollywood-bowl-los-angeles-ca-usa.html)). In 2023 Ambrose began to tease an unreleased song later revealed to be named [“Torture Chamber,”](https://kglw.net/song/torture-chamber) a track from the band’s unfinished rap album.

Presumptuous
An Ambrose-led track with bright keys, percussion, sitar, flutes and Santana-esque guitar parts, “Presumptuous” describes someone who puts down others while believing they’re the center of the world. They are given trust only to throw it all away. The presumptuous person this song is about is left up to interpretation. The subject could just as easily be world leaders and politicians (such as in other Ambrose songs like [“Supreme Ascendency”](https://kglw.net/song/supreme-ascendancy) and [“Smoke and Mirrors”](https://kglw.net/song/smoke-and-mirrors)), someone known personally to Ambrose, or a totally made up scenario that we can all relate to.


“Presumptuous” started as an idea from Ambrose which was sent to Stu, according to a [SPIN interview](https://www.spin.com/2022/04/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mckenzie-interview/). “He sent me a demo of that when we were in lockdown, and I was like, this is sick. This is the recording. He said, what? This is the demo. I was like, no! This is the recording. That ended up being the intro part, and we added the jam later.” In a [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i88mwq3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from May of 2022 Ambrose said the song was inspired by (not about) Rob Thomas, Len and Santana as well as [“Mambo No. 5.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambo_No._5) In the video *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=882s)* Ambrose is seen recording his vocals for the song with Stu interrupting him. The final track was played by Ambrose (vocals/Wurlitzer/percussion), Cavs (drums), Cook (Mellotron/keyboards), Joey (flute) and Stu (guitar/percussion/Wurlitzer/Mellotron/bass) with a unique credit of “party” given to one [Madeline Wright](https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Madeline_Wright/949299) (drummer of [The Bush,](https://www.abc.net.au/triplejunearthed/artist/bush/) a band that also featured Joey’s sister Bella as well as Edith Kenny-Smith). Her sole involvement on the track is the partying sounds heard throughout that start around 1:44. The song was recorded, mixed and produced by Stu. To tease *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)* the band tweeted out [sequences of emojis](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1490547353274961924) for the fans to decipher. Each tweet would be a new name for a song. “Presumptuous” was one of the hardest of the bunch and required the fans to think of the first letter of what was shown. This spelled out the title. It was solved by [@IndependentAni1](https://x.com/IndependentAni1/status/1490774619300798473?s=20). “Presumptuous” was released as part of *Omnium Gatherum* on April 22nd, 2022 and would later become the B-side of [“Gaia”](https://kglw.net/song/gaia?artist_id=1) when it was released as a [limited edition “Lucky Rainbow” 7” single](https://www.discogs.com/release/23299109-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Gaia-Presumptuous-) was sold on tour with leftover copies going to the Gizzverse store. Only one thousand copies were pressed. The single was then reissued later that year on [“Orange Lava” vinyl](https://www.discogs.com/release/25553998-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Gaia-Presumptuous-) in very limited quantities (fifty to one hundred) and sold at the 2022 Forest Hills and St. Kilda record fairs.

The song made its live debut on [2022-05-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-20-2022-agora-cleveland-oh-usa.html) at the Agora in Cleveland, and would see appearances at a handful of other shows in 2022. While mostly a standalone track, the song began to be added to jams in 2023, being paired with [“Ice V”](https://kglw.net/song/ice-v) and [“Hypertension”](https://kglw.net/song/hypertension) while also growing in length. It was transformed into an acoustic jam once on [2023-06-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-4-2023-the-caverns-above-ground-amphitheater-pelham-tn-usa.html).

Predator X
Predator X was the unofficial name given to the Pliosaurus funkei, a large pliosaurid reptile that lived over a hundred million years ago during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Two incomplete skeletons were found by a team of Norwegian paleontologists in Svalbard in 2009 and upon reveal, Predator X was the subject of many sensational headlines with [many reports](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16785-fossil-of-ultimate-predator-unearthed-in-arctic/) noting its size and power. Estimates place Pliosaurus funkei’s full body length at a staggering twelve meters in length, or around thirty-nine feet. For reference, a school bus is about thirty-six feet long. Its bite force was nothing to scoff at either — [33,000 pounds per square inch](https://www.britannica.com/animal/Predator-X)! While going extinct two hundred million years ago, Pliosaurus funkei remains an extraordinary find and in 2022, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard gave it a tribute. With lyrics touting the reptile’s threatening presence and violence, the song is the second and final metal song on *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)*, and it calls back to [“Perihelion”](https://kglw.net/song/perihelion?artist_id=1) from *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)* at the end of its solo.

A rough demo for the song (from *[Demos Vol. 4: Music To Die To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-4)*) reveals that the song was originally faster than the final version. The pause between the song’s solo section is shortened and features a new lead-in. The solo itself is also missing. The ending features a new section with Stu singing the title multiple times in succession. Stu is seen recording the guitar part for the song at 8:54 of *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=882s)*. The final track was played by Cavs (drums), Cook (synthesizer), Joey (bass/guitar) and Stu (vocals/guitar) and was recorded, mixed and produced by Stu. In February of 2022 the band teased *Omnium Gatherum*’s track listing on Twitter using emojis which the weirdo swarm had to decipher. “Predator X” was [represented](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1490549538381529089?s=20) by a shark and a red cross mark, which was figured out by a few people on the 8th. The first to receive confirmation was [@TunaDrinksBeer](https://x.com/TunaDrinksBeer/status/1491278291457941505?s=20). The song was released as part of *Omnium Gatherum* on April 22nd, 2022 and was featured in a [quick promo video](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1517353074792501249) uploaded by the band.

In 2023 the song become the end destination of jams at shows like [2023-03-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-16-2023-x-tra-zrich-switzerland.html) and [2023-03-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-18-2023-schlachthof-wiesbaden-wiesbaden-germany.html), though it was still mostly played by itself.

Red Smoke
“Red Smoke” is one of a number of environmentally conscious songs on *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)*, focusing on bushfires due to the increasingly hot environment and managerial errors leading to a spiraling situation. Led by Ambrose Kenny-Smith in 7/4 time, the song signals the oncoming end of the album with one final slow tune.


The song was played by only three band members: Ambrose (vocals/guitar/Wurlitzer/vibraphone/percussion), Cavs (drums) and Stu (Wurlitzer/bass/vocals/synthesizer). It was recorded, mixed and produced by Stu, and co-recorded by Ambrose. In February of 2022 the band’s Twitter page posted various [combinations of emojis](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1490619034349748229) with the goal of figuring out the song title hidden within them. The song was represented by a raccoon, an eagle, a deer, a night sky and a cigarette with smoke coming out of it. It was guessed by two people though [@citbwtrac](https://x.com/citbwtrac/status/1490730651930267655?s=20) got it first. The color is spelled out with the first letter of each animal’s name while the smoke is self-evident. It was released as part of *Omnium Gatherum* on April 22nd, 2022.


The song gave the band a hard time, so much so that Lucas named it the hardest song from *Omnium Gatherum* to play during King Gizzard’s [2022 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i88j63o/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). “Red Smoke” was played live once on [2022-10-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-19-2022-lolympia-montreal-qc-canada.html) at L’Olympia Montreal. It was performed close to its album counterpart, with a guitar solo from Stu in place of the album’s synth feature.

Candles
“Candles” describes politicians who, instead of proposing changes to policy to help the environment in the face of climate change, instead divert their attention to gods and blind faith. The song finds no sympathy in their politics, arguing that this matter is not just urgent, but relevant to everyone. As they stammer over these problems, time is moving fast and the window to prevent catastrophe shrinks. Despite the confrontational lyrics, “Candles” is an upbeat song with mellow keys, a lot of percussion and a bossa nova feel.

At 15:59 in the video *[The Making of Omnium Gatherum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKo34lJ4XZ4&t=882s)* Stu, Joey and Ambrose are seen in the studio listening to the song before bouncing it (exporting multiple tracks into one track). Joey notes the Mellotron parts, saying that he was “riding the flutter” before talking about a strange Instagram experience. The footage indicates that the song was finished the same day the band was recording [“Blame It On the Weather.”](https://kglw.net/song/blame-it-on-the-weather?artist_id=1) In the end, Ambrose (percussion), Cavs (drums), Cook (synthesizer), Joey (synthesizer/Mellotron) and Stu (vocals/percussion/guitar/Wurlitzer/bass/vibraphone/keyboards) would all be given credits for the song. It was recorded, mixed and produced by Stu. In February of 2022 the band teased song titles through emojis on Twitter and allowed fans to try and figure them out. “Candles” was very simple with [two candle emojis](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1490622542251696129). Two users would guess the song with [@slorchcollector](https://x.com/slorchcollector/status/1490622627043430402?s=20) getting the first liked comment. The song was released on April 22nd, 2022 as the second-to-last track on *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)*. 


“Candles” has not been played live though [Stu has mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k75urb4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that it would be fun.
The Funeral
The shortest of all the songs on *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)*, “The Funeral” is a flamenco jam with only two words sung throughout, creating a mysterious ending to the album that follows [“Candles”’](https://kglw.net/song/candles?artist_id=1) warning of environmental destruction. The song proceeds with the ticking of a metronome at 60 bpm, which not only connects the song to the albums *[Made in Timeland](https://kglw.net/discography/made-in-timeland)* and *[Laminated Denim](https://kglw.net/discography/laminated-denim)*, but demonstrates that every second that passes is time slipping away from us, leading humanity to our collective funeral.


The song was played by Ambrose (percussion), Cavs (drums), Cook (synthesizer) and Stu (vocals/percussion/guitar/Wurlitzer/bass/keyboards/organ). It was recorded, mixed and produced by Stu.  
In February of 2022 the band teased the tracklisting of the new album [through emojis](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1490638666045468674) on Twitter which led to fans guessing the song’s names. The title was guessed by [@AninamHD](https://x.com/AminamHD/status/1490699033668640771?s=20). “The Funeral” hint was convoluted, with a slew of emojis with no relation to each other. However when one took the first letter of each image, it spelled out the song’s title. The song would first appear on *Omnium Gatherum* when it was released on April 22nd, 2022.


“The Funeral” has not been played live.
Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms and Lava
Mycelium
“My main resounding fear is of mushrooms,” Stu said on [Andy Frasco’s World Saving Podcast](https://youtu.be/aUnZ7iEmDxQ?si=R64Oa8KZ2OuD-nE6&t=2690). “Which is really strange, and like, being like a vegetarian person is a really annoying thing to be like, fearful of but I have, like a very…  I’m scared of mushrooms which is a running joke within King Gizz. I just don’t like mushrooms for some reason. Like a lot.” When asked if he was talking about psychedelics alone, Stu clarified and said it was a fear of all mushrooms. Perhaps his uncomfortable attitude towards these fungi can be demonstrated in “Mycelium” — a carefree  track about the spread of mushrooms following the extinction of human beings. The song references different mushrooms such as the [“Devil’s fingers” (Clathrus archeri)](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/fungi/devils-fingers-fungus) as well as the various parts of their structure including the titular [mycelium](https://www.micropia.nl/en/discover/microbiology/mycelium/) — a system of fungal roots that react to the world around them and grow within the soil. Beyond the deceptively gruesome lyrics and a quick callback to the song [“Automation”](https://kglw.net/song/automation?artist_id=1),  “Mycelium” is in the Ionian scale or better known as the major scale. Stu said that the band tried to limit the song’s happiness in a [Guitar World interview](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-omnium-gatherum). “…the straight‑up major scale/Ionian was quite challenging as well. It was about finding something that didn’t feel too happy, too ‘Disney’.” [Joey commented](https://uproxx.com/indie/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-review-discography/) that the song’s scale led it to becoming an “African-type thing,” bringing to mind an influence from Afrobeat. This balancing act seemed to affect the lyrics which can grow rather dark with the song’s third verse mentioning some gnarly side effects of eating certain mushrooms. The end result is a conflicting opener for *[Ice, Death…](https://kglw.net/discography/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava)* that sets up the improvisational tone of the album, as well as the often strange and sinister lyrics. The lyrics were written by Stu, Ambrose, Joey, Cook and Lucas while the music was written and performed by Stu (piano/bass/guitar/organ/vocals/percussion/flute), Ambrose (keys/saxophone), Cavs (drums), Joey (bass/keys/guitar) and Cook (bass/keys/guitar). It was released on October 7th, 2022.


“Mycelium” has never been played live.
Ice V
“Ice V” (pronounced Ice Five) was the first single from King Gizzard’s twenty-first studio album *[Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms and Lava](https://kglw.net/discography/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava)*. The album was the first of three albums in October of that year and the third of five total. From day one the song was a crowd pleaser. From day one it was destined for greatness. Its funky feeling with flutes, saxophones and a ten minute runtime of non-stop jamming is highly infectious and capable of getting anyone dancing. The song takes its name from the [water phase of the same name](https://water.lsbu.ac.uk/water/ice_v.html) and details a meteorite from the moon Ganymede (nicknamed the “queen of ice”) that approaches Earth and brings human extinction through a new ice age.


“Ice V” was a result of the band’s jam sessions based on different scales with this song being based on the Dorian scale. A demo for the song was released as part of *[Good Music To Ensure Safe Abortion Access To All](https://kglw.net/discography/GoodMusic)*, a limited time fundraiser compilation. This version is a completely instrumental jam that runs a little under four minutes in length. The track ends with a reverb-drenched fade out. The song’s surreal lyrics were written by Stu, Ambrose, Cook and Lucas while the music itself was written and played by Stu (guitar/flute/vocals/bass/organ/clavinet/percussion), Ambrose (keys/saxophone/percussion/vocals), Cavs (drums), Joey (bass/guitar/Farfisa), Cook (keyboards/guitar) and Lucas (bass/keyboards). On September 2nd, 2022, the band uploaded a [teaser](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1565840888714215426?s=20) featuring reversed audio found in the song’s intro paired with footage of Joey. Fans opened up editing software and [edited the clip](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/x4fs35/new_single_is_ice_fire_working_on_a_full_version/) to decode the audio. Fans tried to make out the name coming to conclusions like “Ice Fire” and “Ice Burn.” That same day the band [tweeted](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1565874860823564288) a sequence of five ice cubes, similar to the guessing game for the track listing of *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)*. It was released on October 7th, 2022 as the second song on *Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms and Lava*.

A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydeV1_8pM4o) for the song directed by Danny Cohen was released on September 7th, 2022, the same day preorders started for the band’s three October albums. It features Joey dancing to the song throughout Hydra, Greece in various outfits at different locations and times. During the last minute of the video the footage freezes with small phrases on top before once again moving. When put together the phrases read “FEAR IS A FREEZING GULF THAT FLOWS LIKE LAVA THROUGH THE MARIANA TRENCH INTO YOUR BED BLOSSOMING INTO A NIGHTMARE PINNED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF GANYMEDE. FEAR IS A SERPENT THAT SCREAMS IN YOUR EAR FOREVER SAYING ‘YOU’RE NEXT AT THE ABATTOIR.’”
According to a [Gizzymail](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl3/NoGY-qrz4ffCDFBbKtsOWQ?m=AU4AAGVqrYoAAAAL9XQAAAhgPboAAAAAwQ4AAHfXABUqCQBjGSvRTotjuwM0RwySSf3Zj4UK3AAU87M&b=d9ef98cc&e=30cd49d6&x=aGTDYjDNnGQDQYWfM2yaokRyqs1SesWN1PoztmV0Jgo) the video was originally meant to be recorded on the band’s 2022 European Tour with the entire band but was changed after the tour was canceled. Instead Cohen focused on Joey alone on the island Hydra. Ambrose said “so about a month ago or so we had just made the tough decision to cancel our Europe tour back at the start of August when we remembered Danny Cohen had already flown over to Europe from Australia to meet us in a few days to film a clip for ‘Ice V’. Danny was going to come on the road with us for a few weeks and film a clip for the track over a few weeks. We were at the airport waiting for our flight to Prague to play the last show when we called Danny to tell him the news. Joe was still planning on staying in Europe whilst the rest of us were going to head home. Danny was very into Joe’s super euro look and decided he wanted to make the clip with only him. Luckily Joe stepped up [to] the plate and delivered an incredible performance of *Billy Elliot 2* as he danced his way through Hydra, Greece over a few days.” While Danny Cohen found the video amusing, Joey had to be brave for its duration. “This was a big one for me. I had to abandon my ego and dance in public for 12 hours in the scorching hot Greek sun. Let’s just hope that the bride and groom of the 100 person wedding I performed in front of felt like I didn’t steal too much of their limelight.”

The band had teased “Ice V,” such as on [2022-05-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-21-2022-kemba-live-columbus-oh-usa.html), but the song debuted in its entirety during the band’s marathon show on [2022-10-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-2-2022-william-randolph-hearst-greek-theatre-berkeley-ca-usa.html) at the William Randolph Hearst Greek Theatre in Berkeley and would be played three other times before the release of *Ice, Death…* on the 7th. It would be a common song throughout 2022 and continued to be in regular rotation. The song has no set placement, either being a standalone song or the start/destination of a jam. Live versions are usually around the same length of the studio version give or take a few minutes, often in the ten to thirteen minute range. In an interview for [SPIN Magazine](https://www.spin.com/2022/12/king-gizzard-lucas-harwood-exit-interview/) Lucas said the song was his favorite to play because of its funkiness.

Magma
With a bouncy groove and an explosive ending, “Magma” is a fan favorite from *[Ice, Death…](https://kglw.net/discography/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava)* which, of course, focuses on the substance it’s named after. Alongside the descriptions of the material itself, the band describes a “molten god” taking sacrifices and calls back to the *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)* track [“Self-Immolate.”](https://kglw.net/song/self-immolate) Like all songs from the album, “Magma” is based on a specific mode. For this track the band chose the Phyrigian scale. The lyrics were written by Stu, Ambrose, Joey, Cook and Lucas with the music being written and performed by Stu (bass/guitar/vocals/percussion/flute/clavinet/organ), Ambrose (keys/saxophone/percussion), Joey (guitar/bass) and Cook (guitar/keys).

The song made it’s live debut on [2022-10-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-4-2022-roseland-theater-portland-or-usa.html) at the Roseland Theater in Portland with a few other performances before the release of *Ice, Death…* on October 7th, 2022. After the album’s release, “Magma” would be in regular rotation for 2022 often appearing as a standalone towards the end of shows either as the second to last or last song — though there were exceptions such as [2022-10-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-21-2022-forest-hills-stadium-queens-ny-usa.html) where it came out of [“The Dripping Tap”](https://kglw.net/song/the-dripping-tap?artist_id=1) as the second song of the set. This placement largely remained in 2023 but it would start to appear in the middle of sets. Typically live performances of “Magma” are high energy and longer than the studio version, at least by a minute.

Lava
Starting with a flurry of instruments ranging from guitar to flute and saxophones, “Lava” settles into a slow groove where Stu sings about the ways lava can kill and the feeling of sinking in molten rock. After this, the song ends like a volcano erupting with an outburst of guitars and drums as well as a string of ritualistic connected phrases about lava, serpents and death. The basis of “Lava” is the Lydian scale which, according to an interview with Stu for [Guitar World interview](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-omnium-gatherum), was tough for the band. “That was hard for us. We tend to sit on the tonic – the one – and explore it, but Lydian has that sharp four, which means it’s inherently floating outside of its tonic – it doesn’t want you to sit on the one. A lot of our music is muscular and strong and powerful, and Lydian is none of those things. It’s like a cloud, like air – unsolid.”  While the lyrics were written by Stu, Ambrose, Cook and Joey, the music was written and performed by Stu (piano/keyboards/vocals/flute/clavinet/organ), Ambrose (keyboards/saxophone/vocals), Joey (guitar/synthesizer), Lucas (bass), Cook (keyboards/guitar) and Cavs (drums). It was released on *[Ice, Death…](https://kglw.net/discography/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava)* on October 7th, 2022.

Most versions of the song are the same length as the studio version though others have hit the ten minute mark such as the performance on [2023-03-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-7-2023-mnchenbryggeriet-stockholm-sweden.html).

Hell’s Itch
**This song contains subject matter that may not be suitable for all readers as it deals with the topic of self harm.**


“Hell’s Itch” is the fifth song on *[Ice, Death…](https://kglw.net/discography/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava)* and is a fast paced jam utilizing the Mixolydian scale that focuses on the titular [hell's itch](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-the-heck-is-hells-itch), an uncontrollable reaction to sunburn. The lyrics, on top of being uncomfortable, feature in jokes and references. First, the line “flick the switch” initially appeared five years prior within the [alternate lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=artgvkCWxWc) of [“Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg”](https://kglw.net/song/han-tyumi-the-confused-cyborg?artist_id=1). Second, a specific line in the song has caused some confusion; a quick mention of the name Helen in the lyrics “look at me now, Helen. Yes, I’m finally red.” While many fans took this to be a reference to Helen of Troy or even singer Helen Forrest who sang a song called “Oh! Look At Me Now,” the answer is much less epic. Helen is a [nickname](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/xybroa/comment/irh21zm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Ambrose was given, while Joey has the nickname Red. The phrase is just an in-joke that made it to the final version of the track. Musically the song even ties into [“Witchcraft,”](https://kglw.net/song/witchcraft?artist_id=1) [“Dragon”](https://kglw.net/song/dragon?artist_id=1) and [“Flamethrower”](https://kglw.net/song/flamethrower?artist_id=1) as well as *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)* song [“Chang’e”](https://kglw.net/song/chang-e?artist_id=1) by using a similar riff around the three minute mark. “Hell’s Itch” is the longest track on the album and a fan favorite for its unique, airy instrumental and uncomfortable lyrics that capture the condition perfectly. Liner notes indicate that the lyrics were written by Stu, Ambrose, Joey, Cook and Lucas while the music was written and performed by Stu (guitar/piano/bass/percussion/vocals/flute/organ), Ambrose (keyboards/saxophone/percussion/vocals/harmonica), Cavs (drums), Joey (bass/vocals) and Cook (keyboards). It was released on October 7th, 2022.


“Hell’s Itch” has never been played live but was jammed before release during a performance of [“The Dripping Tap”](https://kglw.net/song/the-dripping-tap?artist_id=1) on [2022-04-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-26-2022-gundlach-bundschu-winery-sonoma-ca-usa.html).

Iron Lung
In 1928 Philip Drinker and Louis Agassiz Shaw invented the [iron lung](https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/medicine/iron-lung#who-invented-it) — a large metal capsule attached to vacuums meant to suck in and release air, used for people who’s torso muscles were paralyzed by Polio to enable them to breathe. Being a patient in an iron lung meant existence in captivity,  but until the invention of the [polio vaccine](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/polio) in 1955 it saved thousands of lives.
Nowadays the iron lung is a curiosity of the past — but epidemics, let alone pandemics, are still in fresh memory, and particularly the economic and social lockdowns of Melbourne. The song itself describes someone paralyzed in an iron lung, comparing it to a jail as well as purgatory. Despite this, the patient tries to remain sane.
Over its runtime, “Iron Lung” builds on itself and leads to some of the highest peaks found on [Ice, Death…](https://kglw.net/discography/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava). Out of all of the songs on the album, “Iron Lung” is by far its most popular with its [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njk2YAgNMnE) boasting two million views in only a year, making it one of Gizzard’s most famous songs alongside the likes of [“Gamma Knife”](https://kglw.net/song/gamma-knife?artist_id=1) and [“The River.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-river?artist_id=1) Live performances have ignited audiences since its debut. “Iron Lung” is no doubt a highlight of the band’s five album run in 2022, but it has grown to embody the band as a whole, becoming a classic seemingly overnight.

Like all songs on *Ice, Death…* “Iron Lung” was written as a group with a specific mode in mind. This song in particular uses the Aeolian scale. One of the most interesting lyrics in the song is “it’s a different kind of cuttlefish.” According to an [interview with ABC News Australia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxle4toNKHU&t=201s) the line was meant to be “it’s a different kettle of fish” but Ambrose couldn’t remember the exact quote, instead opting for this vague yet iconic line instead. [He said of his vocals](https://www.spin.com/2022/10/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-reveals-trippy-iron-lung-video/) on the track’s outbursts, “that was me trying to be like Bon Scott or something. That riff is mega. I think I just got to it before Stu could and screamed and squealed.” The lyrics for “Iron Lung” were written by Stu, Ambrose, Cook and Lucas while the music itself was written and performed by Stu (guitar/piano/bass/vocals/organ/clavinet/flute), Ambrose (keyboards/saxophone/percussion/vocals), Cavs (drums), Joey (bass/guitar/Farfisa) and Cook (guitar/keyboards). Fans knew of “Iron Lung” in some form since the spring of 2022. While the band was touring America they would tease and quote the song during performances of [“Slow Jam 1”](https://kglw.net/song/slow-jam-1?artist_id=1) and [“Her And I (Slow Jam 2)”](https://kglw.net/song/her-and-i-slow-jam-2-2?artist_id=1), leading many fans to ask what these new lyrics were about. A Reddit user named u/SLAAAAYER had grabbed a [full lyric sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/uegrh5/snagged_this_from_stus_monitor_at_the_end_of_the/) after their show on [2022-04-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-april-28-2022-bimbos-365-club-san-francisco-ca-usa.html), which gave fans the first glance at the name. For their [2022 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/king_gizzard_ama_gatherum_all/) the band used an account [u/metalliccocoon](https://www.reddit.com/user/metalliccocoon/), taking its name from the song’s lyrics. In this AMA fans were given a few bits of info: that [“Iron Lung” was for a new album](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i89p0ir/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and that [the song had already been recorded](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i88nled/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) — though Lucas would [jokingly respond](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/unjs8a/comment/i88orrn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to a comment acting like he didn’t know what the fans were talking about. The song would make a live debut on [2022-09-30](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-30-2022-moreno-beach-perris-ca-usa.html) at the Desert Daze Festival in Perris and would be played four other times before the release of *Ice, Death…*  on October 7th, 2022.

On September 21st, 2022, the band [teased](https://www.instagram.com/p/CiyccWLqkx4/) the song’s music video with a short clip on their social media with the caption “It’s a different kind of cuttlefish.” Days later on the 26th, [another clip](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ci_oreVq4WP/) was uploaded with the caption “When that cuttlefish hits dif — 4 Oct.” The [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njk2YAgNMnE) for “Iron Lung” was directed and produced by SPOD (Brent Griffin), the band’s first collaboration with the Sydney-based recording artist and producer. Utilizing generative AI, the video is a long sequence of strange images that seamlessly transition into each other. In a press release for the song, SPOD said the video was an experiment that took a lot of time to get down. “When I heard this track, I had just started delving into fully animated AI videos and thought, what a good opportunity to use something I barely understand mixed with my love of effects from the dawn of digital video. So I poured myself into a cyber spiral for a couple of months and this is the result. I love how the song seems like endless ascending and descending cycles culminating in these dramatic explosions and lifts, so it felt like a perfect fit to dive into a nine-minute descent to hell and back. Unfortunately I still dream that I’m spiraling into the eternal abyss and I’m not sure I exist anymore.”

Following the song’s debut “Iron Lung” became an instant classic for the band’s live shows. While some shows had the song appear as a standalone track, such as [2022-12-10](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-10-2022-palace-foreshore-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), others saw it as a destination coming out of a jam, like on [2022-10-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-11-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html) where the song appeared after [“Mr. Beat.”](https://kglw.net/song/mr-beat?artist_id=1) After being a constant for the end of 2022, it would remain in heavy rotation for 2023 while being incorporated in jams more often, either being the start of a jam ([2023-06-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-21-2023-hollywood-bowl-los-angeles-ca-usa.html)) or once again being an ending ([2023-03-15](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-15-2023-alcatraz-milan-italy.html)). While the song would often be paired with [“Hypertension,”](https://kglw.net/discography/laminated-denim) it would continue to be played on its own as well, such as on [2023-05-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-28-2023-boston-calling-music-festival-boston-ma-usa.html), making the song hard to pin down to just one thing. Live performances of the song are typically about the same length of the studio version though some reach around twelve minutes in length (like on [2023-06-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-7-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html)).

Gliese 710
Out in the constellation Serpens is a star that astronomers have noted for a particular reason: it’s approaching us, and at a relatively fast pace. Gliese 710 is still millions of light years away from us but is [traveling](https://www.businessinsider.com/star-hurting-towards-solar-system-2016-12) at 32,000 miles per hour right to the Milky Way Galaxy. While it will not directly hit Earth, in a few million years it will most likely pass through the [Oort Cloud](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/oort-cloud/facts/), a distant region of the galaxy which is home to a large amount of icy debris that could be thrown towards Earth. To close out *[Ice, Death…](https://kglw.net/discography/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava)* King Gizzard names the final song after this star. Like all of the songs on the album, “Gliese 710” uses a unique scale and for this song in particular, the band chose Locrian. In an [interview with Guitar World](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie-omnium-gatherum), Stu said that this was the hardest song on *Ice, Death…* to create. “Locrian was easily the hardest. We were nervous about it so left it last! It’s easy to play Locrian and sound dissonant, but I wanted us to sound deliberate and melodic, but maintain the loose, freewheeling feeling of the jam it came from. We’d done all these other jams beforehand, so once we got into a groove and a pattern, that one, which we called ‘Gliese 710’, kind of clicked.” The music is dark but grand with a taste of *[Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_(King_Crimson_album))*-era King Crimson — perfect for an apocalyptic scenario like the one 710 could bring. The lyrics drive this home by taking the topics seen throughout *Ice, Death…* and bringing them to a close by spelling out their end. The song’s devastating lyrics were written by Stu, Ambrose, Cook and Lucas while the music was written and performed by Stu (guitar/piano/bass/vocals/organ/flute/percussion), Ambrose (keyboards/saxophone/percussion/vocals), Cavs (drums), Cook (keyboards/guitar/bass) and Lucas (bass/keyboards/piano). It was released on October 7th, 2022.


“Gliese 710” has never been played live but [Stu said](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k75j3wr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) it was on his to-do list and could be possible for the band’s 2024 tours.
Laminated Denim
The Land Before Timeland
Opening *[Laminated Denim](https://kglw.net/discography/laminated-denim)* is a bright and breezy fifteen-minute prog rock/krautrock jam called “The Land Before Timeland.” The lyrics are strange, focusing on a process of self-actualization with the help of demons and potentially even time travel. It also namedrops [“The River”](https://kglw.net/song/the-river) and [“Rattlesnake”](https://kglw.net/song/rattlesnake), and also interpolates the main riff of [“Hypertension”](https://kglw.net/song/hypertension), connecting it to the Gizzverse at large. The song features a gong hit every five minutes, tying the song back to *[Made In Timeland’s](https://kglw.net/discography/made-in-timeland)* concept. The song was played by Ambrose (keyboards/percussion/harmonica/vocals), Cavs (drums/percussion), Cook (bass/guitar), Joey (guitar/bass/synthesizer), Lucas (keyboards) and Stu (vocals/guitars/keyboards/synthesizer/percussion).

“The Land Before Timeland” was first heard during the band’s intermission on [2022-10-10](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-10-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html). _[Laminated Denim](https://kglw.net/discography/laminated-denim)_ was released on October 12th, 2022. Alongside the album’s release, the band uploaded the [official countdown clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTm7wzsoU6I) visualiser made by Jason Galea. The countdown clock for “The Land Before Timeland” features a wire frame version of the snake statue seen on the cover of *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)*.


The song has never been played live, but was teased on [2022-10-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-24-2022-rabbit-rabbit-asheville-nc-usa.html). 
Hypertension
The second song on *[Laminated Denim](https://kglw.net/discography/laminated-denim)* is “Hypertension,” a song seemingly about someone time traveling and experiencing hypertension (high blood pressure) while doing so. It features a number of references to the band’s other work: notes outside the scale (microtones), harbinger of changes (the album *[Changes](https://kglw.net/discography/changes)* which was released shortly after *Laminated Denim)*, and sticky red death ([“Lava”](https://kglw.net/song/lava) from *[Ice, Death…](https://kglw.net/discography/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava)*). The song also features a gong hit every five minutes, reinforcing its ties to the passing of time found in the *[Made in Timeland](https://kglw.net/discography/made-in-timeland)* concept. Taking influence from progressive and classic rock, “Hypertension” is a sprawling track with multiple instrumental sections and solos that build to a climatic end. The song’s main riff is also interpolated towards the end of [“The Land Before Timeland.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-land-before-timeland)

According to liner notes, the song was performed by Ambrose (keyboards/percussion/vocals), Cavs (drums/percussion), Cook (guitar), Joey (guitar/bass/synthesizer) and Stu (vocals/guitar/bass/keys/percussion/flute). Before the song was even released it was being hyped up. In Cavs’ [drum seminar at Drumtek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9O9b-U0nl4&t=2822s) in Northcote, he described it as a fifteen-minute “space rock odyssey” and mentioned that it was one of his all time favorite Gizzard songs. Before the album’s release, it was played during the band’s intermission on [2022-10-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-11-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html). “Hypertension” was later released on October 12th 2022. Alongside the album release, the band uploaded the [official countdown clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDJ3nQAanMA) visualiser made by Jason Galea.

The song had been teased as far back as [2022-08-03](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-august-3-2022-tvrdava-sv-mihovila-sibenik-croatia.html) where Stu sang a verse during [“Am I In Heaven?”](https://kglw.net/song/am-i-in-heaven). “Hypertension” saw a live debut on [2022-10-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-23-2022-the-anthem-washington-dc-usa.html) at The Anthem in Washington D.C., appearing as the opener. In the following shows, however, the song would become a destination rather than a starting point coming out of songs like [“Hot Water”](https://kglw.net/song/hot-water) on ([2022-10-26](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-26-2022-the-eastern-atlanta-ga-usa.html)), and [“Iron Lung”](https://kglw.net/song/iron-lung) on ([2022-10-27](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-27-2022-orpheum-theater-new-orleans-la-usa.html)). The song would be played heavily throughout 2023. At the beginning of the year it was back to being a standalone song but began to break back out of that role at the beginning of the residency tour on [2023-06-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-1-2023-the-caverns-pelham-tn-usa.html) where it often came out of [“Ice V”](https://kglw.net/song/ice-v) or “Iron Lung.” Typically, live performances of the song are shorter than the studio version.

Changes
Change
Opening *[Changes](https://kglw.net/discography/changes)* is a thirteen minute R&B/prog opera called “Change.” While unassuming at first, it rapidly develops with many twists and turns, establishing a number of references and set ups for the rest of the album. It starts with verses sung by Stu, featuring a chord progression later used in [“Hate Dancin’”](https://kglw.net/song/hate-dancin?artist_id=1). Here, Stu questions the purpose and power of change — specifically calling on listeners to create social change and to bring equality through mobilization. The second section is [“Astroturf”](https://kglw.net/song/astroturf?artist_id=1)/[“Short Change”](https://kglw.net/song/short-change?artist_id=1)-esque and is sung by Cook. The lyrics question change but rather than focusing on its influence, ask if the change we currently have is actually enough. Following this is Ambrose’s section with an instrumental similar to [“No Body”](https://kglw.net/song/no-body?artist_id=1), and [“Exploding Suns.”](https://kglw.net/song/exploding-suns?artist_id=1) Noticeably darker than the rest, his verse deals with “heroes wearing fake capes” who claim they’re creating change when they’re really searching for power. His answer to this is to expose them, though this is described morbidly with the lyrics comparing Ambrose to a sniper in a tower picking off targets before they can cover up their lies and make excuses. Joey’s section is synth-based with touches of “Gondii,” and brings up how what we view as truth can be completely changed based on circumstance and new information, coming to the conclusion that our own significance is in vain. Following this, we return to Stu’s verse where he proposes a solution: the creation of an ark to take everything good on Earth and protect it, leaving humanity to die. Stu sings along to the melody after this with Ambrose adding in the lyrics “burnin’ up” — bringing to mind climate change. The final section continues this with distorted guitars and a high energy, referencing the album’s closer “Short Change.”  
In its epic runtime, “Change” features all lead vocalists in the band’s discography up to that point, motifs and chord changes found in all the rest of the songs on the album, and also provides a poignant, powerful message about our ability to cause change and to create a better world.


Originally *Changes* was [conceived](https://www.stereogum.com/2202315/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie/interviews/cover-story/) as a concept album with one long song — but the band ended up abandoning this idea and opting for “Change” instead. The song was performed byStu (drums/electric guitar/bass/vocals/Mellotron), Cavs (drums), Ambrose (keyboards/vocals/percussion), Cook (synthesizer/keyboard/vocals/guitar) and Joey (synthesizer/guitar/vocals). Dedicated members of the weirdo swarm had heard segments of the song as far back as May 7th, 2021, when sound engineer Nico Wilson uploaded a [string of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoedbkuSnXk&t=55s) to their Instagram story showing the band playing new material while being filmed by John Angus Stewart of *PHC Films*. At the time, there was much speculation over two songs found in the ASCAP ACE repertory called [“Timeland”](https://kglw.net/song/timeland?artist_id=1), and [“Smoke and Mirrors.”](https://kglw.net/song/smoke-and-mirrors?artist_id=1) After a [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/hey_king_gizzard_the_crew_from_chunky_shrapnel/) featuring the band answering through the account [u/MadeInTimeland](https://www.reddit.com/user/MadeInTimeland/), it was deduced that there was a new album on the way, leading many to believe that what Nico had shown was actually a peek at *[Made In Timeland](https://kglw.net/discography/made-in-timeland)*. The safer (and correct) assumption was that, whatever it was, it would be part of an upcoming documentary that Joey had mentioned in an [NME article](https://www.nme.com/en_au/features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-album-kg-interview-2020-2833101?amp).  
A twist came in January of 2021 when *Made In Timeland* leaked online, compounded by the leaker who had added a clip of Ambrose’s segment from Nico’s Instagram story to the end of “Smoke and Mirrors” — a part that was not on the actual release. In April of 2021 the mysterious film was given a name, *Sleeping Monster*, and was meant to debut alongside *[Chunky Shrapnel](https://kglw.net/discography/chunky-shrapnel)* on May 8th, 2021 at the Astor Theatre in St Kilda. However when the showing came, *Sleeping Monster* was not played. Both the film and “Change” disappeared until September 7th, 2022, when the band opened pre-orders for their three October 2022 albums; one of them being *Changes*. A month later on October 19th, 2022, the band [revealed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4wn6PUskhI) (alongside a snippet of “Change”) that *Sleeping Monster* would be released on Vimeo for a limited time; confirming that Nico’s Instagram footage showed sessions for this documentary. It finally released on October 26th, 2022 and fans finally got to hear “Change” in all its glory, synced to footage of the band playing the song live in studio. *Sleeping Monster* also contains demos of the song, and other material from *Changes*.  
*Sleeping Monster* was followed two days later by the release of the album.


Of the demos heard in *Sleeping Monster*, the first is a slightly faster and brighter version of Stu’s verses with noticeably rougher parts. The second is similar to the first, but has a bass intro. The third is the only known demo of Ambrose’s section, and has a sound closer to Stu’s verses than the darker vibe of the final version.  
In a [Stereogum interview](https://www.stereogum.com/2202315/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie/interviews/cover-story/), Stu said that “Change” was the heart of everything on *Changes*. “‘Change’ is the genesis of the whole record. And then ‘Hate Dancin’ is built out of one of the chord progressions from ‘Change.’ And then ‘Astroturf’ is built out of one of the chord progressions in ‘Change’ as well. And so is ‘Short Change,’ the last song. Every song on the album is built out of a section of ‘Change.’ So yeah, it’s funny how it worked like that. ‘Change’ is this sort of big monster, [this] genesis of little ideas, and the shorter songs on the album are like its children that it gave birth to over five years.” The studio version of the song was recorded by Stu and Nico, and is the only song on the album to have this credit as mostly everything else was done by Stu alone in various locations over five years.


On [2023-03-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-1-2023-highway-holiday-studio-brussels-belgium.html) before their Highway Holidays performance of [“Gaia”](https://kglw.net/song/gaia?artist_id=1), Stu is seen rehearsing the song on synthesizer with Ambrose filming his hand movements. A month later on April 24th, Lucas [uploaded a video](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/12y4ap0/live_change_on_the_way/) playing the song’s bassline with the caption “V fun bassline” — signaling that the song was on the way to the stage.  
“Change” saw it’s live debut on [2023-06-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-13-2023-the-salt-shed-chicago-il-usa.html) at The Salt Shed in Chicago — with Stu exclaiming afterwards that it was difficult to play. The song was played two other times in 2023.  
Unlike the studio version lasting thirteen minutes, the live versions nearly hit the twenty minute mark, with more time spent transitioning between sections. In the band’s 2023 [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k75cr1p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Ambrose responded to a question asking how hard “Change” was to rehearse and said “it took quite a few rehearsals than normal. So glad its in the mem bank now though!”
Hate Dancin’
“Hate Dancin’” is a straightforward and effective song about someone’s distaste for dancing — which is turned on its head after a night at a club where they dance with a woman. Their attitude changes and they are freed to enjoy themselves. The song was the first taste of *[Changes](https://kglw.net/discography/changes)*, and remains one of the most popular tracks from the album.


In a press release for _Changes_, Stu briefly explained its inspiration: “I started writing a song about how I hate dancing, but then I realized that I love dancing.”  
Like all songs on *Changes*, “Hate Dancin’” incorporates elements of the opener [“Change.”](https://kglw.net/song/change?artist_id=1) Here the chord change is taken from Stu’s verses. The song was performed by Stu (vocals/Wurlitzer/organ/bass/synthesizer/guitar), Cavs (drums), Ambrose (vocals/percussion) and Joey (synthesizer). It was released as the second track of *Changes* on October 28th, 2022 and received a limited edition [7” single release](https://www.discogs.com/release/25421905-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Hate-Dancin) on Lucky Rainbow vinyl in December of 2022 for the St Kilda Record Fair. 


On October 17th, 2022, “Hate Dancin’” received a [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRF8Nko1EDY) shot, directed and edited by John Angus Stewart. It consists of the band dancing and acting goofy in slow-motion.  
When talking about the dancing in the video in an [interview for KCRW](https://www.kcrw.com/music/shows/music-special/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-lucas-harwood-interview-hollywood-bowl-tickets), Lucas said “we were having lots of fun with that. We created the specific conditions that allowed us all to get there, to love dancing.”


“Hate Dancin’” was first played on [2023-06-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-7-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html) at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, and only played one more time in 2023 (on [2023-06-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-12-2023-the-salt-shed-chicago-il-usa.html)). 
Astroturf
Astroturf as a product was invented in 1965. [As stated on the manufacturer’s website](https://astroturf.com/astroturf-the-story-behind-the-product-that-revolutionized-sports-surfaces/), it was the result of the US Army noting a gap in health between urban and rural soldiers, which they attributed to a lack of green spaces in American cities. Their answer was to fund the company Monsanto to create synthetic grass that would be better than concrete. A year after its creation, the Houston Astrodome installed the product (then known as ChemGrass) onto their field, where it gained its recognizable name. Since then, the product has gained a particular reputation. The term “astroturfing” became a way to call out non-grassroots movements — pushing their artificial nature into the spotlight. The tactics used to astroturf range from sockpuppet accounts, to funding groups and pundits to manufacture a movement out of nothing. Since 1965, the product and the concept have changed our society — but on *[Changes](https://kglw.net/discography/changes)* King Gizzard takes a different approach. On the appropriately named “Astroturf”, with a funky instrumental, the band details humanity’s attempts to get rid of the natural world and to change those spaces to artificial ones. On top of the destruction of land, the lyrics also depict our adoption of single use plastics for “better business”, and our resentment for non-human beings through lines about plugging wormholes and walking on lawns with the knowledge that no animal would ever be there.  
The choruses focus on the thoughts of a butterfly unable to complete its life cycle due to the lack of a natural environment. Haunting theremin-like synths, a groovy bassline, an infectious drum beat, a long solo section on the back end of the track, and chord changes heavily adapted from [“Change”](https://kglw.net/song/change?artist_id=1) make “Astroturf” a standout moment on *Changes*.


In the documentary *Sleeping Monster*, we get to hear a demo of “Astroturf” with a noticeably different groove reminiscent of a reggaeton beat. It also features a unique lead melody on keys, though it keeps the unique three note breakdown. This demo also appeared in [promotional material](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1582137252959748096?s=20) for *Sleeping Monster*. The first mention of the song in the public eye was all the way back on August 28th, 2021 while promoting the video for [“Ya Love.”](https://kglw.net/song/ya-love?artist_id=1) A [post](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1431566500280684549?s=20) showcasing screenshots of the video was captioned “6 butterflies fluttered by; looked horrified” — the first line of the chorus. The song was performed by Stu (bass/vocals/Mellotron/organ/Wurlitzer/synthesizer/keyboards/flute), Cavs (drums), Ambrose (keyboards/saxophone/vocals/percussion) and Joey (synthesizer/guitar).  
*Astroturf* was released as the third track on *Changes* on October 28th, 2022.


A [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql_z7t6WGPg) shot and edited by Jason Galea was released on January 24th, 2023. It’s primarily composed of the band playing the song in their studio with Stella Rennex of the band Parsnip. The final quarter is footage of the band in New Orleans doing various activities like getting a tarot card reading, smoking cigars, and taking photos with parrots. [Stu explained](https://newnoisemagazine.com/news-king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-share-astroturf-video/) the process of filming like this. “We filmed this live then overdubbed the fuck over it. Recording is fun.” From the looks of it, the footage seen is the band recording the studio version — though Stella Rennex is nowhere to be found on the album based on liner notes. More footage of these sessions can be found in *Sleeping Monster*.


“Astroturf” saw a live debut on [2023-06-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-2-2023-the-caverns-pelham-tn-usa.html) at The Caverns in Pelham, and would see a good amount of performances throughout the rest of 2023. Live versions are played close to the record, though a drum solo on [2023-06-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-21-2023-hollywood-bowl-los-angeles-ca-usa.html) signaled that it has the capability of evolving.
No Body
Describing the feelings of someone who finds themselves in purgatory after dying, “No Body” is a smooth, soulful song led by emotional guitar parts akin to the work of David Gilmour or Don Felder (especially 3:16 which resembles moments of “Hotel California”). The final studio version of the song was performed by only Stu (vocals/Wurlitzer/bass/guitar/synthesizer), Cavs (drums) and Ambrose (keyboards/percussion/vocals), and released as part of *[Changes](https://kglw.net/discography/changes)* on October 28th, 2022.


A demo for the song can be heard in the film *Sleeping Monster*. This recording is close to the final version, but lacks the lead guitar part and vocals with the keyboard playing the main melody. The song, like all tracks on *Changes*, takes motifs from [“Change”](https://kglw.net/song/change?artist_id=1) — “No Body” taking the main melody, slowing it down and changing its rhythm for lines like “to be not real, to have no soul, to have no body.” The song received a limited edition [7” single](https://www.discogs.com/release/26298470-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-No-Body-Exploding-Suns) for the Gizzverse Record Fair in Amsterdam.


“No Body” has never been played live.
Gondii
By far the most synth-heavy song on *[Changes](https://kglw.net/discography/changes)*, “Gondii” is a brisk track with an odd groove (3/4 drums in a 4/4 song) about Toxoplasma gondii; a parasite that can infect warm blooded animals, and sexually reproduces in cats. [Studies have shown](https://www.science.org/content/article/brain-parasite-may-strip-away-rodents-fear-predators-not-just-cats) that Toxoplasma gondii actually affects the brains of mice — creating cysts which make them more curious and less anxious when infected, which in turn makes them more susceptible to attacks by predators. This manipulation is the focus of “Gondii.” While the band plays with sequencers and synthesizers, the lyrics describe someone being “domesticated” after being infected — losing their free will to the parasite and living with a stream of serotonin to their brain. This leads them to the conclusion that rather than being the cat in the scenario, they’re actually the rat. The song was performed by Stu (vocals/Wurlitzer/synthesizer/percussion), Cavs (drums), Joey (synthesizer), Cook (synthesizer) and Ambrose (percussion/vocals). It was released on October 28th, 2022 and was later the b-side on the limited edition [7” single](https://www.discogs.com/master/3156840-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Hate-Dancin) of [“Hate Dancin’”](https://kglw.net/song/hate-dancin?artist_id=1). All of the songs on Changes are built around motifs found in [“Change.”](https://kglw.net/song/change?artist_id=1) “Gondii” takes its influence mainly from Joey’s verse but also takes the main melody of the song at 1:40.


“Gondii” has never been played live.
Exploding Suns
A [sun explodes](https://phys.org/news/2014-01-sun.html) when it runs out of hydrogen in its core. Our sun is no different, and will most likely explode in a few billion years — though it doesn’t have the mass required for a supernova. While we don’t exist anywhere near a star that’s explosion would risk human life, [if](https://supernova.eso.org/exhibition/1215/) the sun were to explode right now, it would no doubt engulf Earth in a ball of gas ending all life on the planet, before becoming a white dwarf and fading away. This existential (though distant) scenario is the focus of “Exploding Suns,” the sixth track on *[Changes](https://kglw.net/discography/changes)* released October 28th, 2022. Backed by a chill but dark instrumental with haunting synths and snapping, Stu and Ambrose sing of the chance of armageddon at any moment, and the potential fallout, wrapping back around to a time before life.


A few demos for the song appeared in the film *Sleeping Monster*. The first version features a drum machine, a different melody with alternate lyrics, and a slower tempo than the final version. The second demo has a real drum kit, as well as a keyboard that plays a loose version of the song’s melody. Another clip shows a similar (if not the same) snippet with bass, and a new section that is not on the final version.  
The song was first foreshadowed all the way back in 2017 during the song [“Murder of the Universe”](https://kglw.net/song/murder-of-the-universe?artist_id=1), where Han-Tyumi, vomiting an extraordinary amount of bile, says “exploding suns vomit comets.” *Changes* was [originally intended](https://www.stereogum.com/2202315/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-stu-mackenzie/interviews/cover-story/) to be released that year, and according to a [press release]) the final version of “Exploding Suns” was recorded at the same time. “Murder of the Universe” was most likely trying to connect to what was, at the time, considered to be the fifth album of that year. Only Stu (vocals/Wurlitzer/synthesizer/bass), Cavs (drums), Cook (bass/synthesizer) and Ambrose (percussion/vocals) play on the song. “Exploding Suns” is also the only track on *Changes* recorded by Sam Joseph. Like the rest of the songs on _Changes_, this song takes influence from the album’s opener [“Change.”](https://kglw.net/song/change?artist_id=1) The chords and melodies are built around Ambrose’s section of the track as well as the opening motif. It was released on October 28th, 2022 as part of *Changes*, and was later made the b-side of [“No Body”](https://kglw.net/song/no-body?artist_id=1) for a limited edition [7” single](https://www.discogs.com/release/26298470-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-No-Body-Exploding-Suns). 


This song has never been played live.
Short Change
“Short Change” is a chaotic and fittingly short song that wraps up *[Changes](https://kglw.net/discography/changes)* released October 28th, 2022. The song is mostly instrumental and features a cavalcade of distorted guitars, arpeggiated synthesizers and heavy drum rhythms filtered through lo-fi production, and even reversed tracks. There’s only a handful of lyrics here; all of which are lifted from the beginning of [“Change.”](https://kglw.net/song/change?artist_id=1) In fact the track is built around Cook’s verse of that song, with elements of Stu’s verses and influence taken from its closing section. It was performed by Stu (electric guitar/bass/vocals/Mellotron/Wurlitzer/synthesizer), Cavs (drums) and Ambrose (percussion).

PetroDragonic Apocalypse
https://kglw.net/blog/petrodragonic-apocalypse-narratives.html put where you see fit
Motor Spirit
*[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)* starts on a high note with one of the most intense and expansive songs in the band’s metal repertoire, “Motor Spirit.” Between the finger-tapping guitars, yelling and growly vocal deliveries, motifs of [“Witchcraft”](https://kglw.net/song/witchcraft?artist_id=1), [“Flamethrower”]https://kglw.net/song/flamethrower?artist_id=1) and [“Gaia”](https://kglw.net/song/gaia?artist_id=1) and numerous time and tone changes, Stu sings of a world that has given into gasoline, worshiping it as a holy fluid that allows their parasitic trucks and cars to function. Worship is not an exaggeration, as the lyrics compare oil to seraphs with its narrator stating that instead of praying to God, they kiss the ground in affection of their new holy water. Yet due to humanity’s fixation on oil and wealth, the world is pushed to the brink through climate change of biblical proportions. “Motor spirit” was originally coined as a formal term for gasoline/petrol, although it is far less popular now than it was back in the early 1900s. In fact, many longstanding oil and gas companies such as BP, Mobil and Shell used the phrase prominently in marketing and on their products. Within the song, however, it represents a new near-religious movement that prioritizes the accruement of wealth over the wellbeing of the planet. 


It was first heard in its entirety between sets on [2023-06-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-8-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html) and was released on June 16th, 2023. For the album *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*, the opening of “Motor Spirit” was adapted to create the bassline of [“Theia.”](https://kglw.net/song/theia?artist_id=1) The extended version of that song features the “motor spirit” chant. The extended version of the title track also takes the idea of drinking motor oil in its added lyrics.

“Motor Spirit” was played rarely throughout 2023. It was initially teased during “Gaia” going all the way back to [2023-02-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-25-2023-northcote-theatre-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) and made a live debut on [2023-06-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-7-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html) at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison as part of a show-opening sandwich of “Gaia” > “Motor Spirit” > “Gaia.” This partial version of the song skips the first section and instead kicks in during the second. It would be played one more time on [2023-06-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-11-2023-the-salt-shed-chicago-il-usa.html) at The Salt Shed in Chicago as part of a longer jam of “Gaia” > “Motor Spirit” > [“The Great Chain of Being”](https://kglw.net/song/the-great-chain-of-being?artist_id=1) > “Gaia.” The song would be abandoned going into 2024 and as of writing the entire song has not been played live.

Supercell
With thrash metal influence and some of the hardest hitting rhythms on *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)* that Joey [has likened to](https://www.spin.com/2023/06/king-gizzard-petrodragonic/) being inside of a tornado, “Supercell” fits its name. A supercell is a type of thunderstorm known for its rotating updraft core, a condition [prime for creating tornadoes](https://www.wcnc.com/article/weather/weather-iq/weather-iq-supercell-thunderstorm-severe-weather-tornadoes/275-0cc1760d-260c-4b5c-ad53-6a2dbc9c1691). In the album’s narrative, these storms make their way across the world with devastating consequences. The band utilizes various references to tornadoes (sickle wedge, [Jupiter’s Great Red Spot](https://www.space.com/jupiter-great-red-spot.html)), as well as their depictions in popular culture (eg. *[The Wizard of Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_Wizard_of_Oz)*, or the idea of cows being picked up) to illustrate a chaotic, deadly apocalypse. 


During a show on [2022-10-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-6-2022-paramount-theatre-seattle-wa-usa.html) at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, Stu mentioned that they had written more songs about the end of the world. When asked what songs in particular by Joey, he responded “it's about tornado alley, all the storms merging together and dragons.” This would be the first mention of “Supercell,” as well as the story of *PetroDragonic Apocalypse*. The song was released as the second track on the album on June 16th, 2023 with a [limited 7” single](https://www.discogs.com/release/28076959-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Supercell-Converge) with the b-side of [“Converge”](https://kglw.net/song/converge?artist_id=1) for the band’s Barcelona record fair on August 24th, 2023.  
On *[The Silver Cord,](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)* the opening riff of “Supercell” was adapted with a change in key and rhythm to create the main opening melody of [its title track](https://kglw.net/song/the-silver-cord?artist_id=1). 


The song made a live debut before the release of _PetroDragonic Apocalypse_ on [2023-06-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-1-2023-the-caverns-pelham-tn-usa.html) at The Caverns in Pelham for the first show of the band’s 2023 Residency Tour. The song would then reappear at every residency and was played a modest amount afterwards through the rest of 2023. The song is mostly played on its own, although their Splendour in the Grass show on [2023-07-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-july-22-2023-north-byron-parklands-wooyung-nsw-australia.html) saw it come out of [“Self-Immolate.”](https://kglw.net/song/self-immolate?artist_id=1)

Converge
As massive storms rage across Earth, *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse_](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)* shifts focus to the International Space Station where a crew of humans watch the destruction from afar, unable to help in any way — “Converge” is their viewpoint of the apocalypse. The song connects to the rest of the album using motifs and concepts such as the first verse of [“Dragon”](https://kglw.net/song/dragon?artist_id=1), and the belief in [“Motor Spirit”](https://kglw.net/song/motor-spirit?artist_id=1) being the thing that propelled the station into orbit in the first place. Musically the song is one of the most brutal, with chugging guitars and extensive double bass drumming that expand into massive choruses featuring Ambrose on vocals. As the song goes on, the band experiments with new riffs and rhythms before exploding into a final, twisting section that ends with a dark reprise of the song’s intro. 


<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYrP00-5u8E?si=osQoP1J-zG317gHY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><div style="text-align: left;">


The history of “Converge” starts with the release of *[Demos Vol. 4: Music To Die To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-4)* on July 15th, 2022. Among the many rough outlines and unused tracks was a fast thrash metal piece with a weird time signature called “Uncolonize.” The demo is much shorter than the final track, and only features a take on the ending section (starting at 4:07) with some missing compositional elements and an added lower-pitched breakdown. Later that year, the demo was used as walk on music on [2022-08-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-2-2022-st-michaels-fortress-sibenik-croatia.html) at St. Michael’s Fortress in Sibenik. In April of 2023 [fans noticed](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/12yrv1m/demos_3_4_uncolonize_changed_to_converge_on/) that the song’s title had been changed from “Uncolonize” to “Converge (Demo).”  The studio version of “Converge” was released as the third song on *PetroDragonic Apocalypse* on June 16th, 2023, with the band uploading a [video of Cavs waking Ambrose up](https://x.com/kinggizzard/status/1669603382028562433?s=20) to the song on their social media to celebrate. For the Barcelona Gizzverse Record Fair on August 24th 2023, the song was made the b-side of a [limited 7” single](https://www.discogs.com/release/28076959-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Supercell-Converge) for [“Supercell.”](https://kglw.net/song/supercell?artist_id=1) The song has been referenced a few times in other Gizzard tracks, such as on *PetroDragonic Apocalypse* where the chant at 3:28 is reprised for the first verse of “Dragon.”  
Later that year *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)* adapted “Converge” on the track [“Set”](https://kglw.net/song/set?artist_id=1) by using a riff from the song’s outro (4:59) in part of the song’s main melody. The extended version of that track also features the word “converge” repeated like it is on the original song.

“Converge” made its live debut earlier than most other *PetroDragonic Apocalypse* songs on [2023-05-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-28-2023-boston-calling-music-festival-boston-ma-usa.html) at the Boston Calling Music Festival, making it the second song from the album to be heard in its entirety by fans (the first being “Gila Monster”). It would then appear at most stops on the band’s 2023 Residency Tour, with seven more appearances afterwards. It was originally played on its own, but later changed to fit the album’s track listing with a transition into [“Witchcraft”](https://kglw.net/song/witchcraft?artist_id=1) from [2023-08-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-12-2023-grape-festival-piestany-slovakia.html) onwards (though it first happened on [2023-06-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-8-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html)).

Witchcraft
In “Witchcraft” a group of humans convene and attempt to stop the ongoing, apocalyptic storms. Channeling the four elements, they begin to recite incantations on behalf of a blood moon goddess. Despite their attempts, the plans are foiled by a black cat named Beowulf who knocks a candle down onto a stack of scriptures which ignites a taxidermied gila monster that is subsequently turned into a dragon that attacks the witches. The song is based around a distinct use of time signatures and a main riff that [Joey said](https://www.spin.com/2023/06/king-gizzard-petrodragonic/) evokes the supernatural. “When ‘Witchcraft’ comes, there’s that eastern-y lead sound, which feels like an incantation or the occult.” 


“Witchcraft” holds a few references to other songs in the band’s discography. The recognizable melody appears in the track [“Motor Spirit”](https://kglw.net/song/motor-spirit?artist_id=1) and [“Dawn Of Eternal Night.”](https://kglw.net/song/dawn-of-eternal-night?artist_id=1) The breakdown in the song (2:29 and 3:45) which originally appeared in [“Hell’s Itch”](https://kglw.net/song/hells-itch?artist_id=1) (2:53) reappears on [“Dragon”](https://kglw.net/song/dragon?artist_id=1) (0:53) and [“Flamethrower”](https://kglw.net/song/flamethrower?artist_id=1) (4:28) as well as [_The Silver Cord_](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord) song [“Chang’e.”](https://kglw.net/song/chang-e?artist_id=1) The song’s ending bass line is also reprised at the end of “Dragon” (8:43).  “Witchcraft” may also reference this song lyrically, with its mention of a blood moon goddess that may allude to Chang’e, the goddess of the moon in Chinese mythology. The extended version of that song includes quotes of “Witchcraft”’s bridge, as well as extensive use of the word “witchcraft.” Beowulf is also mentioned in the extended version of [“Extinction.”](https://kglw.net/song/extinction?artist_id=1) “Witchcraft” was released on June 16th, 2023 and became the b-side of [“Gila Monster”](https://kglw.net/song/gila-monster?artist_id=1) for a [limited edition 7”](https://www.discogs.com/release/27444102-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Gila-Monster-Witchcraft-/image/SW1hZ2U6OTcxNDE0MjI=) sold during the band’s record fair in Los Angeles.

The live debut of “Witchcraft” occured during “Drag Night” at The Caverns Above Ground show in Pelham on [2023-06-03](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-3-2023-the-caverns-above-ground-amphitheater-pelham-tn-usa.html) — before the release of *PetroDragonic Apocalypse*. It would then make an appearance at every single stop of the residency tour and would stay in regular rotation beyond. While first played on its own, the song was commonly paired with [“Converge”](https://kglw.net/song/converge?artist_id=1) like it is on the album. This trend began to become the norm on [2023-08-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-12-2023-grape-festival-piestany-slovakia.html), although an initial pairing at the early show at Red Rocks on [2023-06-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-8-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html) preceded it. That said, Gizzard bucked the trend in early 2024 as “Witchcraft” was often being played on its own or as a part of a longer jam such as on [2024-03-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-14-2024-teatro-coliseo-santiago-chile.html) and [2024-03-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-23-2024-autodromo-de-interlagos-sao-paulo-brazil.html).

Gila Monster
Living mainly in the southern United States is a venomous reptile known as the Gila monster (pronounced with a soft j sound like hee-lah, not ge-lah). Taking its name from the Gila River Basin, it is a small lizard with a beaded orange and black pattern. Despite the name and venom, the animal isn’t very dangerous as they are slow creatures that [mainly eat eggs and baby animals](https://www.chieftain.com/story/lifestyle/2009/12/07/gila-monsters-really-not-all/8522452007/). Death in humans due to a Gila bite is extremely rare — before [a death](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68348902) in early 2024, the last recorded instance of a lethal bite [was in 1930](https://azcentral.newspapers.com/article/arizona-republic-gila-monster-bite-fatal/121317383/?locale=en-US). Of course, humans have been more dangerous to them rather than the other way around. A [2018 report](https://www.wildlife.state.nm.us/download/conservation/share-with-wildlife/reports/2017/Evaluation-of-the-distribution-and-conservation-status-of-the-Gila-monster-Heloderma-suspectum-in-southwest-New-Mexico-_-Tom-Giermakowski.pdf) showed they face threats due to the destruction of habitat, the effects of droughts spurred on by climate change and other factors stemming from human involvement. That said, with its distinctive coloring, the Gila monster has become an iconic lizard and has seen use in pop culture such as in the 1959 B-movie The Giant Gila Monster, where a massive monster (ironically played by a beaded lizard, not a Gila monster) attacks a bunch of sockhopping, drag racing teens. In the story of *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)*, this reptile takes a similar role. After the cat Beowulf knocks over a candle (described in [“Witchcraft”](https://kglw.net/song/witchcraft?artist_id=1)),  a string of events occurs which leads to a ritual going wrong, and a Gila monster transforming into a dragon. Now much larger than before and with newfound abilities, the gila monster eats the witches and begins a rampage. The song is a description of its bloodlust and violence that also makes references to the natural world, including the constellation Boötes as well as the hadal zone — the deepest part of the ocean. The story of the Gila monster is one of hubris: humanity tries to fix a problem but only digs the hole deeper, with catastrophic results.

The song initially debuted three months before the release of _PetroDragonic Apocalypse_ on [2023-03-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-4-2023-013-tilburg-netherlands.html) at 013 in Tilburg and would be played thirteen more times before the album arrived. These versions often didn’t feature the name drop heard during the outro.

On May 7th, 2023, the band [posted photos of themselves](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/posts/866158914870406) in cloaks with Stu’s Holy Explorer to their social media. The post read “Making music videos is funny.” After an [announcement on the 12th](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/posts/868773694608928), on May 16th the band released the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQX2CsMCB9M) and [single](https://www.discogs.com/release/27100446-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Gila-Monster) for “Gila Monster.” Directed, animated and edited by SPOD (Brent Griffin), it shows Stu adorned with a cloak making his way across a fantasy landscape on horseback, while the rest of the band attempt to summon the Gila monster with Ambrose leading the ritual. At the end of the video Stu removes his cloak to reveal Joey, who plays a solo before showing the silhouette of the monster in the distance. The video consists largely of green screen footage of the band with 3D animation by SPOD. In a press release for _PetroDragonic Apocalypse_, he said “I wanted to shoot *Lord of the Rings 4* but also make a video game, so I mixed both mediums and came up with this majestic journey for truth and power in a cursed world. I mixed 3D animation, modeling & live footage in a 3D video game program to create this marvelous voyage of man & beast. Friend or foe?” Lucas commented on Ambrose’s appearance in the video in a Gizzymail stating, “Amby’s face is the most evil I’ve ever seen it. It’s actually so fucking scary and it’s already giving me nightmares.” According to an [Instagram comment](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsP8Q86uzuY/) the video was animated in Unreal Engine. The video would be [nominated for an ARIA](https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/2023-aria-awards-nominations-complete-list-1235417564/) under the “Best Video” category at the end of the year.


For the release of [“Dragon”](https://kglw.net/song/dragon?artist_id=1) on June 6th, “Gila Monster” was used as a [b-side](https://www.discogs.com/release/27465447-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Dragon) for the digital single. It was released as part of *PetroDragonic Apocalypse* on June 16th. On vinyl copies of _PetroDragonic Apocalypse_ the Gila monster’s point of view is narrated by Leah Senior on [“Dawn Of Eternal Night.”](https://kglw.net/song/dawn-of-eternal-night?artist_id=1) “Gila Monster” received a [limited edition 7”](https://www.discogs.com/release/27444102-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Gila-Monster-Witchcraft-/image/SW1hZ2U6OTcxNDE0MjI=) with the b-side of “Witchcraft” for the band’s record fair in Los Angeles afterwards. For *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*, the riff in Ambrose’s section of “Gila Monster” was reinterpreted into [“Gilgamesh”](https://kglw.net/song/gilgamesh?artist_id=1), while the “Gila” chants can be heard in the extended version of that song.

Following the release of *PetroDraognic Apocalypse*, “Gila Monster” (as it appeared on the album) was in regular rotation. While often played on its own it was also paired with [“Gaia”](https://kglw.net/song/gaia?artist_id=1) for a sandwich of “Gaia” > “Gila Monster” > “Gaia” (see [2023-09-03](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-29-2023-le-bikini-toulouse-france.html) for an example). As for song placement, it would usually appear towards the very beginning or end of sets, especially by August and September of that year. Since then the song has reappeared regularly as part of “Gaia” > “Gila Monster” > Gaia.”

Dragon
The longest song on *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)* is “Dragon” — a constantly changing prog-metal epic about the Gila monster’s (introduced in [“Witchcraft”](https://kglw.net/song/witchcraft?artist_id=1) and [“Gila Monster”](https://kglw.net/song/gila-monster?artist_id=1)) rampage. The first section is heavy, with extensive bass drum use and a thrash metal sound evoking carnage via a melody first heard in [“Converge”](https://kglw.net/song/converge?artist_id=1) (3:27). This leads to a second, Tool-inspired section where we hear that the military tries to take the beast down to little success. Following this, we get a chant followed by verses in latin sung by Joey which summon the dragon proper. The third section goes back to a more thrash-inspired riff, with a callback to “Witchcraft”’s outro before ripping into a syncopated, growly breakdown. After this we return to the start of the song with a final description of the dragon, which flies into the air, leading to the next song [“Flamethrower.”](https://kglw.net/song/flamethrower?artist_id=1) A fan favorite from the album, “Dragon” is a mythological track that evolves the band’s past prog experimentations (such as [_Polygondwanaland_](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland) which is referenced with an altered riff from [“Tetrachromacy”](https://kglw.net/song/tetrachromacy?artist_id=1)), while providing a new experience not yet heard in the band’s discography. Fans knew of a song about dragons from [2022-10-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-6-2022-paramount-theatre-seattle-wa-usa.html) where Stu mentioned that the band had written more apocalyptic material, saying “it's about tornado alley, all the storms merging together and dragons.” While _PetroDragonic Apocalypse_ is heavy on its environmental themes, the band has left the interpretation of the dragon up to fans. As Joey said in an [interview for 3voor12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITMKcuZUSpU), "maybe a dragon isn't just a dragon, maybe it's, y'know, Donald Trump or the rising ocean. Maybe that's the dragon."

After a teaser on [June 3rd, 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/13zlipj/new_music_vid/), Jason Galea’s [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpUKO-WKaqo) for “Dragon” was released on June 6th. Starting with a montage of the band [first seen on tour in 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgBb9rpNENs&t=2s) the video then changes to show a horde of lizards heading towards an oil refinery with a plane crashing into one of the reservoirs. The reptiles shoot fireballs at the refinery to blow it up, while others run around and drink the oil. This section is interspersed with older footage of the band playing the song in studio. For the “Tool” section, we see the skeleton of a dragon put together leading to the reveal of a mechanical dragon. As the band plays on (with Joey singing the latin section), we see someone run from the beast into the forest. After another section of the band playing, we see an army of tanks prepare to shoot the dragon, before being crushed in rhythm with the song’s breakdown. During this, a high-tech spaceship flies by and destroys more oil refineries before latching onto the International Space Station and flying directly into the ground — destroying both. The person running is revealed to be a 3D model of Stu in a biker jacket, who is chased by the dragon even while on the back of a bike. After a massive stunt jump, Stu escapes, leading to the final moments of the song where the band is once again seen in the studio. The video uses a limited color palette consisting mainly of black, white, red and orange, and is in a 4:3 aspect ratio with many hallmarks of analog video production. [Galea said](https://www.stereogum.com/2226070/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-dragon/music/) of the video: “over the last two months I dusted off my music video computer to slay the 10 minute ‘Dragon.’ I wanted to explore a harsh distorted visual palette using my live visual setup mixed with PS1 cutscene inspired animation and studio footage I filmed of the band. The animation was created using Cinema 4D, and processed through After Effects and a Tachyons circuit bent video unit.” Alongside the video release was a [single](https://www.discogs.com/release/27465447-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Dragon) with the b-side of “Gila Monster.” It was released on Petrodragonic Apocalypse on June 16th, 2023. For the album *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*, [“Swan Song”](https://kglw.net/song/swan-song?artist_id=1) takes the melody from the song’s second section break with the extended version featuring the lyrics heard before the latin quotes.

“Dragon” took some time to debut. Cavs said in an [interview for Modern Drummer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMxYSfiqNjk) that “Dragon” was a hard song to tackle. “Some of the hardest ones are the ones that are the really fast songs and like a lot of polyrhythms so definitely ‘Dragon’ when we start playing that. We’re almost there. When we start playing that, that’s gonna be like, really, really hard.” He specifically noted that its opening and closing parts in eleven are difficult. After being soundchecked for a while, the song made its live debut on [2023-08-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-16-2023-den-atelier-luxembourg-luxembourg.html) at Den Atelier in Luxembourg as part of a massive sandwich of [“Gaia”](https://kglw.net/song/gaia?artist_id=1) > “Gila Monster” > “Dragon” > “Gaia.” This proved to be an exception to the rule as the following performances saw “Dragon” as a standalone track, sometimes a show closer. The song would only be played five times in 2023. Early in 2024 the song was played numerous times as a standalone track, often faster than the studio version.

Flamethrower
“Flamethrower” is a fast metal track with chugging guitars and polyrhythms that brings the end of *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse’s](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)* story. Rising into the air, the gila monster-turned-dragon decides to rain fire on Earth to destroy humanity. Lighting gasoline, the dragon scorches the planet in flame and oil while also destroying the International Space Station — the last place in the galaxy to host human life. The song ends with a five-minute long outro, which goes from a distorted metal riff accompanied by metal drumming in six, to a new version of the riff utilizing synthesizers and electronic drums. This leads listeners into the next album in the band’s discography *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*, while also making one last reference to *PetroDragonic Apocalypse* with a chant from [“Motor Spirit”](https://kglw.net/song/motor-spirit?artist_id=1) over a melody from [“Witchcraft.”](https://kglw.net/song/witchcraft?artist_id=1) as well as [“Dragon”](https://kglw.net/song/dragon?artist_id=1), [“Hell’s Itch”](https://kglw.net/song/hells-itch?artist_id=1) and [“Chang’e.”](https://kglw.net/song/chang-e?artist_id=1)  Alongside all this, “Flamethrower” references [“The Great Chain Of Being”](https://kglw.net/song/the-great-chain-of-being?artist_id=1) by using the line “I disrupt the natural order,” connecting the ascension on that track to the birth of the dragon.


In a [2023 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k76ky4x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Stu mentioned that _PetroDragonic Apocalypse_ had the working title of *Flamethrower*. Before release, the song had been hinted at by the band. For example, a [presale code](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/13m97dv/flamethrower_flamethrower/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for the band’s 2023 tour was “flamethrower”. Then on March 12th, 2023, the band [uploaded a clip](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cpsxfu_oibx/) of Joey playing a snippet of the song and headbanging to it with Stu, the caption reading “New album locked and JOEDED.” First heard played over the PA on [2023-06-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-8-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html), the song was released as the finale of *PetroDragonic Apocalypse* on June 16th, 2023. It was later referenced on the extended edition of *The Silver Cord* where during [“Extinction”](https://kglw.net/song/extinction?artist_id=1) the chorus chant from “Flamethrower” can be heard.


“Flamethrower” has never been played live, although it has been teased such as during [“Her And I (Slow Jam 2)”](https://kglw.net/song/her-and-i-slow-jam-2-2?artist_id=1) from [2022-11-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-2-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html) and [“Sense”](https://kglw.net/song/sense?artist_id=1) on [2023-02-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-25-2023-northcote-theatre-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html).
Dawn Of Eternal Night
“Dawn Of Eternal Night” is a fourteen-minute long bonus track for *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)* that can only be found on vinyl copies of the album. For this, Leah Senior reprises her role as narrator for the first time since [“The Castle In The Air”](https://kglw.net/song/the-castle-in-the-air?artist_id=1) from *[Polygondwanaland](https://kglw.net/discography/polygondwanaland)*. “Dawn Of Eternal Night” tells the story of the album from the perspective of the Gila monster. The song is mostly spoken word with dark, atmospheric synthesizer work behind her and features a quick reference to the main riff of [“Witchcraft.”](https://kglw.net/song/witchcraft?artist_id=1)

The Silver Cord
Theia
In an [interview with DIY Magazine](https://diymag.com/cover-feature/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-the-silver-cord-november-cover-feature) Ambrose describes Stu’s collaborative writing prompt for “Theia”: “Theia is a hypothesised planet that once had a binary orbit with Planet Earth. Eventually, Theia crashed into Earth, breaking a huge chunk off which coalesced into and became the moon.”
The timing to make a song about this planet couldn’t have been better as only a week after *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*’s release, [scientists found potential remnants of the planet](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/03/world/earth-moon-theia-collision-llvps-scn/index.html). The name comes from the Greek goddess Theia, who was one of the twelve titans — children of Uranus and Gaia (previously referenced on *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)*). Theia is the [god of vision and light](https://mythopedia.com/topics/theia) with a name that translates to “goddess.” While the song “Theia” is a bubbly synth-pop look at the planet’s fate with Earth, the name brings up the imagery of mythology found throughout *The Silver Cord*.

As with every tracklisted song on *The Silver Cord*, “Theia” has two versions: a standard and an extended mix. Theia was first released on October 3rd, 2023 as part of a triple single alongside [“The Silver Cord”](https://kglw.net/song/the-silver-cord?artist_id=1), and [“Set”](https://kglw.net/song/set?artist_id=1), as the standard mixes with [music videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnsD-fEHdY) from Jason Galea. Theia’s segment of the video shows the band singing the song in a French forest with a pink color filter and various datamoshing transitions, while wearing the Radio Eyewear ‘Gator Vision’ sunglasses made to promote the album. The standard mix comes in at under four minutes, while the extended mix lasts over 20 minutes, making it the band’s longest studio track at the time of release. It also features new lyrics, including a verse taken from the album’s title track. [Stu said](https://www.undertheradarmag.com/news/king_gizzard_the_lizard_wizard_announce_new_album_share_theia_silver_cord) of the different cuts, “the first version’s really condensed, trimming all the fat. And on the second version, that first song, ‘Theia,’ is twenty minutes long. It’s the ‘everything’ version…” “Theia” corresponds to [“Motor Spirit”](https://kglw.net/song/motor-spirit?artist_id=1) from sister-album *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)*, using a riff taken from the opening as its main bassline. The extended version also features guttural chants of “Motor Spirit''.


“Theia” has not been played live but it has been teased, such as on [2023-06-13](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-13-2023-the-salt-shed-chicago-il-usa.html) during [“Hot Water.”](https://kglw.net/song/hot-water)  
The Silver Cord
As the title track, “The Silver Cord” is an important part of the album, giving the first glance at the album’s darker electronic influence, as well as the more spiritual side of the project. In an article for [SPIN magazine](https://www.spin.com/2023/10/cerebral-asteroids-king-gizzard-the-silver-cord/) Stu describes the band’s conceptual process for creating *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*: “We were thinking about the soul and the spirit and existentialism and why we’re here, birth and death, and rebirth and spirituality.”
Perhaps no song encapsulates this more than its Joey-led title track. Its name refers to the metaphysical silver cord first mentioned in Ecclesiastes 12:6-7, which serves as a tie or tether between one’s physical body and their astral body. The first verse of the song describes an apostle telling someone to remain unborn within bardo, a stage between life and death found in Buddhism, while the second is the narrator’s rebirth and subsequent freedom. Musically, “The Silver Cord” starts as an eerie passage with heavily modulated vocals from Joey, that leads to an even more discordant section before the tension is finally released, signifying its protagonist's rebirth by reducing the discordant overtone modulation. Here the song opens up into major chords with brighter instrumentation.

As with every tracklisted song on *The Silver Cord*, “The Silver Cord” has two versions: a standard and an extended mix. The Silver Cord was first released on October 3rd, 2023 as part of a triple single alongside [“Theia”](https://kglw.net/song/theia?artist_id=1), and [“Set”](https://kglw.net/song/set?artist_id=1), as the standard mixes with [music videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnsD-fEHdY) from Jason Galea. In “The Silver Cord” section of the video, Joey mimes the lyrics while dancing in a forest and at a staircase accompanied by Cavs, both wearing the Radio Eyewear ‘Gator Vision’ sunglasses made to promote the album. The standard mix runs over four minutes in length, while the extended mix lasts nearly 13 minutes and features a variety of new sections with drum and bass elements.
“The Silver Cord” corresponds to [“Supercell”](https://kglw.net/song/supercell?artist_id=1) from sister-album *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)*, taking the opening riff and changing the key and rhythm to form the song’s bassline. The lyrics of “The Silver Cord” are also used in the extended version of “Theia.”


“The Silver Cord” has not been played live.
Set
“Set” is an electronic anthem [likened to Technotronic’s “Pump Up The Jam” by Ambrose](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k75cd03/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that details the rise to power and death of the Egyptian mythological god of the same name.
In ancient Egyptian mythology, Set/Seth is a god with the head of an undetermined animal referred to as a sha, or Set animal (typically depicted as a jackal), who oversees storms, deserts and chaos. Set is most known for his role in [the legend of his brother](https://egyptianmuseum.org/deities-osiris) Osiris, a former ruler of Egypt. In a jealous rage, Set killed Osiris, scattered his body across the land, and became king. After Osiris’ death, his wife Isis and Set’s sister and wife Nephthys find the pieces of Osiris and resurrect him. Now reunited, they have a child, Horus, who goes on to avenge his father by killing Set to become the new king with Osiris becoming the ruler of the underworld.


As with every tracklisted song on *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*, “Set” has two versions: a standard and an extended mix. The standard version comes in just under four minutes, while the extended version breaks off the standard outro to keep to the main rhythm with new lyrics for over ten minutes total runtime. “Set” corresponds to [“Converge”](https://kglw.net/song/converge?artist_id=1) from sister-album *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)*, adapting a riff heard in its outro (4:59) into the main melody. The extended mix also features guttural chants of “Converge”. *The Silver Cord* brings the god Set back for the longer [“Extinction”](https://kglw.net/song/extinction?artist_id=1) at the end of the extended edition. Interestingly, the phrase “cut the cord” featured in [“Swan Song”](https://kglw.net/song/swan-song?artist_id=1) was first used in the [alternate lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=artgvkCWxWc) of [“Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg.”](https://kglw.net/song/han-tyumi-the-confused-cyborg?artist_id=1)

“Set” was first released on October 3rd 2023 as part of a triple single alongside [“Theia”](https://kglw.net/song/theia?artist_id=1), and [“The Silver Cord”](https://kglw.net/song/the-silver-cord?artist_id=1), as the standard mixes (though “Set” continues about 1 minute extra into the extended mix) with a long [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnsD-fEHdY) from Jason Galea. In the “Set” section of the video, Stu and Ambrose dance and sing to the song in various locations with different color filters while wearing the Radio Eyewear ‘Gator Vision’ sunglasses made to promote the album.
Some of the footage was recorded on August 17th, 2023 near Grand Bé in St Malo, France, when the band became temporarily [trapped](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/15tw5uq/the_tide_has_risen_king_gizzard_is_trapped/) due to rising tides while filming.

Chang'e
In Chinese mythology, [Chang’e](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Change-Chinese-deity) was the wife of [Hou Yi](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hou-Yi), a legendary archer who had shot the ten suns which once surrounded and threatened Earth. In response, he was given the pill of immortality/the immortality elixir. While the story changes from version to version, Chang’e at some point took this gift and floated upwards to become the goddess of the moon where she is helped by the moon rabbit. She has since been celebrated as part of the Mid-Autumn Festival. On *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*, her tale is told, starting with the ten suns wreaking havoc and ending with her ascension to godhood. “Chang’e” is one of the calmest tracks on the album, with euphoric vocals and chord changes fitting for a song about a goddess.

As with every tracklisted song on *The Silver Cord*, “Chang'e” has two versions: a standard and an extended mix. The standard version clocks in at three minutes and forty-seven seconds, while the extended version builds on the final section of the song, taking lyrics from the breakdown of “Witchcraft.” to extend out to ten minutes and forty-seven seconds. “Chang’e” is linked to *The Silver Cord*’s sister-album *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)*, taking a riff originally from [“Hell’s Itch”](https://kglw.net/song/hells-itch?artist_id=1) (2:53) heard in [“Witchcraft”](https://kglw.net/song/witchcraft?artist_id=1) (2:29 and 3:45), [“Dragon”](https://kglw.net/song/dragon?artist_id=1) (0:53) and [“Flamethrower”](https://kglw.net/song/flamethrower?artist_id=1) (4:28) and changing its key. “Witchcraft” also mentions a blood moon goddess, a potential reference to Chang’e herself. The god is later named in the song [“Extinction.”](https://kglw.net/song/extinction?artist_id=1) 


“Chang’e” has not been played live but it has been teased like on [2023-06-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-11-2023-the-salt-shed-chicago-il-usa.html)..
Gilgamesh
The hero Gilgamesh comes from Mesopotamian mythology and is found in the aptly titled *Epic of Gilgamesh* — the [oldest surviving story of literature](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/2020/04/30/the-epic-of-gilgamesh/). In the tale, the king of Uruk, Gilgamesh, searches for eternal life alongside the wild man Enkidu. After a number of trials and tribulations, Enkidu dies and Gilgamesh finds the plant of eternal youth, which is then stolen by a snake. This causes him to give up on his quest for immortality.
In *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*, the epic is described in the song simply titled “Gilgamesh.” The track even spells out its own name acrostically through two sections sung by Stu, the start of each sentence featuring a letter of the title. “Gilgamesh” is a darker track with guttural vocals from Stu as well as some rapping from Ambrose. The song takes the phrase “cut the cord” from an [alternate set of lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=artgvkCWxWc) for [“Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg.”](https://kglw.net/song/han-tyumi-the-confused-cyborg?artist_id=1) 


The first mention of “Gilgamesh” was on September 17th, 2023 when the band [uploaded photos of them](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxUgB8Yx943/?img_index=1) recording *The Silver Cord* with the first set of lyrics that spell out the song’s title. Some fans noticed the clever lyrics and pointed it out in the comments.


As with every tracklisted song on *The Silver Cord*, “Gilgamesh” has two versions: a standard and an extended mix. The standard version comes in at three minutes and forty-four seconds while the extended version includes new lyrics (some of which spell out the title [“Swan Song”](https://kglw.net/song/swan-song?artist_id=1)) and runs eleven minutes and fourteen seconds long. “Gilgamesh” corresponds to [“Gila Monster”](https://kglw.net/song/gila-monster?artist_id=1) from sister-album *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)*, by reinterpreting a riff from Ambrose’s sections to make its bassline, while the “gila” chants can be heard in the extended version. 


“Gilgamesh” has not been played live.
Swan Song
“Swan Song” sings of the end times at the hands of climate change, with a mythological bent forecasting a new world to rise out of the destruction. The track starts with a loud alarm-like synth melody with a harsh techno beat to follow. While more abrasive than most songs on *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*, the track also features tranquil passages that break up the action.


As with every tracklisted song on *The Silver Cord*, “Swan Song” has two versions: a standard and an extended mix. The standard version runs four minutes and twenty-five seconds, while the extended mix features more arpeggiated synthesizers and unique lyrics for ten minutes and thirty seconds. “Swan Song” corresponds to [“Dragon”](https://kglw.net/song/dragon?artist_id=1) from sister-album *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)* by taking the melody from its breakdown. The extended version also quotes the chorus chants heard before Joey’s latin vocals. “Swan Song” is also referenced on the extended mix of [“Gilgamesh,”](https://kglw.net/song/gilgamesh?artist_id=1) where the first letter of each lyric in a verse spells out the song’s title. Interestingly, the phrase “cut the cord” featured in “Swan Song” was first used in the [alternate lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=artgvkCWxWc) of [“Han-Tyumi, the Confused Cyborg.”](https://kglw.net/song/han-tyumi-the-confused-cyborg?artist_id=1)  


“Swan Song” has not been played live.
Extinction
With one of the most memorable hooks from *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)*, “Extinction” is the album’s closing track that brings everything to a transcendental end. It is, of course, about extinction, but references various gods mentioned throughout *The Silver Cord* ([Chang’e](https://kglw.net/song/chang-e?artist_id=1) and [Set](https://kglw.net/song/set?artist_id=1) in particular). It also nods to other tracks in the band’s discography like [“Crumbling Castle”](https://kglw.net/song/crumbling-castle?artist_id=1) and [“The Acrid Corpse.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-acrid-corpse) The song features vocals from Stu and Ambrose and is an upbeat track despite its dark lyrics.


The band had hinted at the song live such as on [2023-06-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-7-2023-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html), where Ambrose sang its opening line during a [“Robot Stop”](https://kglw.net/song/robot-stop?artist_id=1) jam. In September, the title was used as a presale code for the band’s 2024 marathon shows in the United States. 


As with every tracklisted song on *The Silver Cord*, “Extinction” has two versions: a standard and an extended mix. The standard version runs short of five minutes, and the extended cut goes for twelve minutes. “Extinction" corresponds to [“Flamethrower”](https://kglw.net/song/flamethrower?artist_id=1) from sister-album *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)*, by bringing back the chorus vocals, as well as a quick reference to Beowulf from the track [“Witchcraft.”](https://kglw.net/song/witchcraft?artist_id=1) The song is also mentioned on the extended mix of [“Swan Song.”](https://kglw.net/song/swan-song?artist_id=1) 


“Extinction” has not been played live.
Space Junk
“Space Junk” is the first hidden track from the standard vinyl release of *[The Silver Cord](https://kglw.net/discography/the-silver-cord)* and the only one on the album’s first side. The songs were originally found in the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/16gpwb1/yang_song_titles/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The track’s name is noted in the matrix number on the album’s dead wax. The song is an instrumental centered on an arpeggiated synth that is expanded into a rave-like jam. In the band’s [2023 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k76da0q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu said the bonus songs were made when experimenting with the sound for *The Silver Cord*. “Space Junk” is the longest of the bonus tracks on the album.

[First discovered](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/16gpwb1/yang_song_titles/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in the ASCAP ACE Repertory, the track’s name is noted in the matrix number on the album’s dead wax. It starts with a pulsing bass synth that turns into a marching rhythm with a number of strange synth parts put over it. In the band’s [2023 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k76da0q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu said the hidden songs were made when experimenting with the sound for *The Silver Cord*.

Starting with the fade out of “Plasma,” “Embryo” has wonky synthesizers on top of a driving rhythm that leads to a fast-paced instrumental jam. In the band’s [2023 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k76da0q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu said the hidden songs were made when experimenting with the sound for *The Silver Cord*.

Demo No. 79
Filled with percussion and strengthened by a tight funk beat, “Demo No. 79” is an instrumental [by Joey and Stu](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/909947925) with a fast, rhythmic pace. Some fans have [speculated](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/te53g3/demo_no_79_is_just_gaia_init/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that the riff heard a minute in was later adapted into the main melody of the *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)* track [“Gaia,”](https://kglw.net/song/gaia) though it has a different rhythm and unique notes.

Stevie Ray Horn
“Stevie Ray Horn” is a Can-inspired jam [written by Stu](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/909948021) with a title that is a play on the name of famous bluesman Stevie Ray Vaughan.

King Gizzard [called the track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oXA4DK1P1Q)  “Jam 2018” in chat. The band had actually played similar instrumentals on [2018-08-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-20-2018-alter-schlachthof-dresden-germany.html) (featured in *[THE NONAGON MOVIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV8knE56GE4&t=388s)*) and [2018-08-22](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-august-22-2018-manufaktur-schorndorf-germany.html), meaning that this track may have been inspired by their soundchecks.

Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To
Music To Eat Bananas To
Starting with a simple but funky groove, “Music To Eat Bananas To” is a cheery instrumental with floaty, high-pitched lead synth work. [Written by Stu](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/909948022), it first appeared during an [unannounced live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ge8A4pC6mE&t=290s) on September 2nd, 2020 where the band played a number of unused tracks and demos. Following the stream, Stu mentioned plans for a 24/7 YouTube radio station in the [second Gizzymail](https://email.gizzverse.com/nl2/xjos8/xviv.html). “Last week we tried a youtube live stream. Working on 24/7 King Gizz radio. Music to eat bananas to. Ya know? It’s hard though because youtube kept taking the stream down for copyright infringement LOL.” On October 1st, 2020, the song was officially released as the title track of *[Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2)*.

9 TET
“9 TET” is a fully electronic microtonal instrumental [written by Stu](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/909948023) that shares some similarities with tracks like [“Melting”](https://kglw.net/song/melting) and [“Flying Microtonal Banana.”](https://kglw.net/song/flying-microtonal-banana) Its title refers to [nine-tone equal temperament](https://en.xen.wiki/w/9edo). Unlike the twelve tone temperament found in most Western music or the twenty four-tone temperament used by Gizzard in their microtonal music, nine-tone splits an entire octave into nine different intervals. It was released on [_Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To_](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2) on October 1st, 2020.

Demo No. 67
Led by Mellotron, electronic woodwind and Stu’s voice, “Demo No. 67” is a bright and energetic instrumental with some stylistic similarities to [_Butterfly 3000_](https://kglw.net/discography/butterfly-3000) and [_Gumboot Soup_](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup). The song was [written by Stu](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/909948024) and debuted on an [unannounced live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ge8A4pC6mE&t=290s) on September 2nd, 2020.

The 10th Boogie
“The 10th Boogie” is an upbeat track [written by Stu](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/909948025) with prominent keys and synths over a groovy rhythm section. The song even features some unusual instrumentation, such as what appear to be recorders. When asked why “The 10th Boogie” was never used during the band’s [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6k5aw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Ambrose said “Yeh I was real into that one! There was a few others that were cut too that I liked. Hopefully they come back to life someday.”  
It's unclear where the title came from as by the point of its release, King Gizzard had only released five tracks with the word “boogie” in the title. It was released on [_Demos Vol. 2: Music To Eat Bananas To_](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2) on October 1st, 2020.

Scared of Christmas
Fans have often joked about the possibility of a King Gizzard Christmas album, but the premise has been rejected by the band. “I’m sorry guys, we don’t have current plans to make any [unintelligible] Christmas album…” Stu said during an [interview with Anthony Fantano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8MtjdwLZww&t=381s). “I hate religion and consumerism. Christmas is the ultimate, like, fusion of those two things, so, you know, unlikely.” Even Cavs has [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnr6jyi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the unlikelihood of such a release. The holiday has made scant few appearances in their discography, notably in the track [“God Is Calling Me Back Home,”](https://kglw.net/song/god-is-calling-me-back-home) but Stu’s distrust of the holiday would be put into the title of what is their only explicitly holiday-related number: “Scared of Christmas.” The song, [written by Stu](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/909948026), was first heard as part of an [unannounced live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ge8A4pC6mE&t=290s) on September 2nd, 2020 where the band played various demos and unused material. Originally fans labeled the track as a demo for the [_Flying Microtonal Banana_](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana) song [“Melting”](https://kglw.net/song/melting) but when it was officially released as part of [_Demos Vol. 2:  Music To Eat Bananas To_](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-2) on October 1st, 2020, it was given its official title.

Gypsy
**KGLW.net recognizes the title’s overtones of Anti-Romani racism and strongly opposes bigotry and hate of any kind.**


“Gypsy” is an unreleased song written by Stu that had been added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396568) alongside Gizzard’s early singles/_[Anglesea](https://kglw.net/discography/anglesea)_ before the release of _[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)_ in 2013. 

We at KGLW.net believe that the song was played at least twice in 2011. The first known appearance would be on [2011-02-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-12-2011-geelong-gaol-museum-geelong-vic-australia.html) at the Geelong Gaol in Geelong for a Forte Magazine Christmas function. The other performance would be on [2011-03-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-4-2011-the-grace-darling-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at The Grace Darling Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) during the _Anglesea_ release party. The song’s identity was determined by studying the vocals, which led us to transcribe the lyrics as: “when you think you are gonna die, don’t worry babe I’m by your side, we’ll steal those tears from the gypsies [sic] eyes.”

Due to the title’s similarity to later lyrics, this may be an early version of [“Eddie Cousin”](https://kglw.net/song/eddie-cousin) from _Anglesea_ (later _[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)_), but this has not been confirmed.

Jam
“Jam” is an unreleased song that was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396573) alongside Gizzard’s early singles/_[Anglesea](https://kglw.net/discography/anglesea)_ before the release of _[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)_ in 2013.  
While the band has no doubt jammed live, it’s unclear what exactly “Jam” is. On July 6th, 2012, the [Flightless Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/flightlessrecords/11-jam-1) account posted the song [“Sea of Trees”](https://kglw.net/song/sea-of-trees) with its URL containing the “Jam” title. A track of the same name is briefly seen on a setlist during the [live video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrI7hfBIrdg) for “Willoughby’s Beach,” shot on [2012-05-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-9-2012-kings-cross-hotel-potts-point-nsw-australia.html). This could mean that “Jam” is an early version of “Sea of Trees,” although there has been no confirmation.
Love For Me
“Love For Me” is an unreleased upbeat garage rock tune about love written by Stu. The song features vocals split between Stu and Lucas.

A tape of this show is the only recording of the track currently available to fans.

OCS
“OCS” is an unreleased song written by Stu that was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396577) alongside Gizzard’s early singles/_[Anglesea](https://kglw.net/discography/anglesea)_ before the release of _[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)_ in 2013.  


Its title may be a reference to the psychedelic rock band Thee Oh Sees/Osees, who’s first incarnation was simply written as OCS. The band was massively influential on King Gizzard, especially during the formative period in which this song was written. Ambrose, while [reflecting on the times he saw the band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afzkmbKxaNo), said “Stu and Gizzard saw them for the first time and it was just like, from there, just, continuously took so much influence from that to start Gizzard…” [Stu said to Triple J](https://web.archive.org/web/20111129014623/http://www.triplejunearthed.com/Artists/FeaturedArtist.aspx?artistid=41113) in 2011 “I don’t think we’ve developed a sound. We’re still just fucking around in the garage. I think we’re just making loud noises and passing it off as music. Basically I just took the best songs from the best Oh Sees records and added a Bo Diddley beat.”

Oh God
“Oh God” is an unreleased song written by Stu, a mid-tempo,ominous track with a prominent rhythm section, almost bringing to mind the U2 song [“Bullet The Blue Sky.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_the_Blue_Sky) Its lyrics are repetitive and simple, touching on the topic of religion similar to [“Crookedile”](https://kglw.net/song/crookedile) from *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)*. It was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396578) alongside Gizzard’s early singles/_[Anglesea](https://kglw.net/discography/anglesea)_ before the release of _[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)_ in 2013.

Stoned
“Stoned” is an unreleased song written by Stu that was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396583) alongside Gizzard’s early singles/_[Anglesea](https://kglw.net/discography/anglesea)_ before the release of _[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)_ in 2013.  
It’s an upbeat garage rock track seemingly about a girl getting stoned and her interactions with her mother and a priest. It was [initially reported to be](https://whothehell.net/archives/12881) a cover of Split Enz’ [“She Got Body, She Got Soul.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2ADsedKs64) The song features a similar melody but is not a match. In later years, fans interpreted the song to be an early version of the *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)* track [“Stoned Mullet,”](https://kglw.net/song/stoned-mullet), though this seems unlikely considering the working title of that song is known to have been “Jack-It.”


The earliest known performance was on [2011-12-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-9-2011-meredith-supernatural-amphitheatre-meredith-vic-australia.html) during Merideth Music Festival. The other known performance was from [2011-12-31](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-31-2011-the-esplanade-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at The Esplanade Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). The song’s identity was determined by closely examining the vocals in the existing tape and transcribing the lyrics as “You gotta breathe in to get stoned. Yeah I wanna be alone.”

It is possible that “Western” is related to the Western movie soundtrack style of [“Sam Cherry’s Last Shot”](https://kglw.net/song/sam-cherrys-last-shot), or _[Eyes Like They Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky), although this is only speculation.

Eucalyptus Noserun
“Eucalyptus Noserun” is an unreleased song that was meant to be on the album _[Oddments](https://kglw.net/discography/oddments)_. The only reason we know of the song’s existence is a photo [posted on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/photos/pb.100044289166773.-2207520000/733067783372794/?type=3) on December 15th, 2013. The [photo](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F64j2xhdce3981.jpg)shows Stu’s computer with an alternate track listing for the album. Here, the song is listed with a runtime of two minutes and forty-eight seconds. The song’s status is unknown and  it has likely been lost after a laptop of Stu’s containing much of *Oddments* was [stolen](https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/king-gizzard-the-murlocs-lost-entire-recordings-in-computer-robbery/), although this was earlier in the year than the Facebook post.

High School
During the creation of _[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)_ there were a number of working titles that the band used for different songs and motifs. While some kept their names such as [“Wah Wah,”](https://kglw.net/song/wah-wah), many titles such as “Motorhead Ending” (later [“Road Train”](https://kglw.net/song/road-train)) and “New Metal” faded into obscurity as relics of the creative process. One, however, has remained a point of interest as the band actually played it live multiple times, though no recordings of it are known to exist. That piece is “High School.”


We know that the band had recorded the track in August of 2015, as an [Instagram post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/i6bxud/highschool_am_i_dumb_and_i_dont_know_this_song_or/) by Jamie Wdziekonski shows it on tape next to songs like [“Mr. Beat”](https://kglw.net/song/mr-beat) and [“Gamma Knife.”](https://kglw.net/song/gamma-knife) On December 1st, 2015, Rolling Stone published an article called [King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard Talk Infinitely Looping Concept LP](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-talk-infinitely-looping-concept-lp-187873/). The piece, written by Kory Grow, talks about the band recording *Nonagon Infinity* at Daptone Records in Brooklyn and features the only material info on the song known to exist. “Back at Daptone, Mackenzie leads the group in a tight, Krautrock-influenced segue connecting songs with tentative titles “Mr. Beat” and “High School.” The tape whirs, and when they stop, the engineer pulls out a razor to splice it.” This indicates that the two songs were meant to transition into one another at this point in the album’s history. Gizzard played “High School” a few times following these recording sessions. The earliest reported performance of the song was on [2015-12-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-december-2-2015-john-curtin-hotel-melbourne-australia.html) at the John Curtin Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne). It would make at least two other appearances that year, one on [2015-12-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-december-6-2015-howler-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at Howler in Naarm and another on [2015-12-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-9-2015-the-metro-theatre-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html) at The Metro Theatre in Eora (Sydney). The final reported performance of the track would be on [2016-02-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-february-16-2016-rescue-rooms-nottingham-england.html) at Rescue Rooms in Nottingham. No recordings of the song exist, leading fans to believe that it was an early version of a track from _Nonagon Infinity_. If this is the case, by process of elimination (assuming the set list notation is correct), “High School” could only be a working title for [“Big Fig Wasp”](https://kglw.net/song/big-fig-wasp) or [“Invisible Face”](https://kglw.net/song/invisible-face), as the rest of the tracks from _Nonagon Infinity_ were either on tape alongside it or were played during the same show as it. That said, without accurate info for these four shows, it remains unclear what “High School” exactly was.
Nonagon Intro Theme
On November 10th, 2016, King Gizzard released the song [“Rattlesnake.”](https://kglw.net/song/rattlesnake) Inspired by Krautrock, the song is a repetitive, hypnotic piece that introduces the listener to microtones — or notes outside of the twelve tone scale most commonly used in Western music. These notes and pitches would become a foundational element for a lot of the band’s music going forward on albums such as *[Flying Microtonal Banana](https://kglw.net/discography/flying-microtonal-banana)*, _[K.G.](https://kglw.net/discography/kg)_ and [_L.W._](https://kglw.net/discography/lw) as well as _[Sketches of Brunswick East](https://kglw.net/discography/sketches-of-brunswick-east)_ and _[Gumboot Soup](https://kglw.net/discography/gumboot-soup)_. However, “Rattlesnake” was not the first song officially released by the band to feature microtones. That honor goes to [“Robot Stop”](https://kglw.net/song/robot-stop) from _[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)_, released earlier that year on April 29th and featuring microtonal guitar during its instrumental break. That said, if we really want to get technical, this wasn’t even the first time fans had heard the band dabble with new notes. While not officially released, the band’s first known experimentation outside the twelve tone scale was heard in early 2016 in the form of the track “Nonagon Intro Theme.” Centered around a simple drum beat, it features a chaotic, disjointed lead part on microtonal synthesizer. While the full song has not been heard by fans, we know it goes for at least a bit over two minutes total. The song is incredibly obscure within the band’s canon, and something only true diehards have any recollection of.


The track (accompanied by a short video) was used to open King Gizzard’s live shows in early 2016. The song played overtop footage of the nonagon putting itself together slowly. It’s unclear how many shows this intro was used for. Only one appearance is known to exist for certain: [2016-03-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-2-2016-ancienne-belgique-brussels-belgium.html) at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels. Footage of this was captured both [by the venue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGHgpVU3UuU&t=26s) and by Jason Galea, who included it at the end of the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w)*; the song gets its title from the description of Galea’s video. Available tapes from the time seem to indicate that it may have only appeared at a few shows. The band’s gig on [2016-02-28](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-february-28-2016-z-bau-nuremberg-germany.html) at the Z-Bau in Nuremberg, only a few days before Brussels, does not contain the intro. Moving past March, their Levitation performance at the Barracuda in Austin on [2016-05-01](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-1-2016-barracuda-austin-tx-usa.html) also doesn’t seem to have it. It seems that the track was only played in a window of March to April, though a lack of tapes from that specific time period make it impossible to know for sure.

Unreleased (“Riff Raff”)
In March of 2018, King Gizzard played an untitled instrumental two times. The song, intended to be recorded for an unknown, then-upcoming album, heavily resembled the AC/DC track [“Riff Raff”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErXbMB9R5-0) from their 1978 album Powerage. Since its disappearance, the song remains a curiosity in the band’s catalog with no releases and little info offered by the band. It’s the only taste of a project for which there is little info, but speculation could lead us to infer that it may have become _[Infest the Rat’s Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)_.

The first known performance was on [2018-03-06](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-6-2018-paradiso-grote-zaal-amsterdam-netherlands.html) at the Paradiso Grote Zaal in Amsterdam. Stu introduced the song by saying this: “We’re gonna try something here… we’re recording this tonight. We’re recording this. We’re gonna try something now. This is kinda new. It’s got no words yet. We’re gonna record it and work some other shit out later but… *unintelligible* I’m scared.” It was played one more time on [2018-03-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-11-2018-neue-theaterfabrik-munich-germany.html) at the Neue Theaterfabrik in Munich. Before playing the track, Stu once again mentioned that the band were recording the performance. In the years following, however, the band never gave an explanation as to what this was. This led some to [theorize](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/alg15l/comment/efdry4c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that it was cut due to its similarities to the AC/DC song “Riff Raff,” which the band began to use as intro music later that year. However when asked if the song would ever see the light of day during King Gizzard’s [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/g3bi64/comment/fnqh5wg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu said “forgot about this one! might have to resurrect it from the dead…”

Torture Chamber
“Torture Chamber” is an unreleased hip hop song featuring a verse by Ambrose. Fans have known of it since [2023-06-02](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-2-2023-the-caverns-pelham-tn-usa.html) when it was quoted during a jam on [“The Grim Reaper.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-grim-reaper) Following performances of that song also featured the quotes, leading the weirdo swarm to believe that a hip hop album was on the way. When asked about it during an episode of [Office Hours Live With Tim Heidecker](https://youtu.be/4koSNtnfRqw?t=3291), Joey said that “Torture Chamber” was from a hip hop album that was “in the pipeline,” which he claimed was “one step too far,” even questioning if fans actually wanted a full rap LP. Stu also mentioned the album during Gizzard’s [2023 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/17k4ti4/comment/k75eizd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) saying that it was never finished but that the material will probably morph into some other project.

Old explanation (DO NOT INCLUDE)
This song has not been officially released or acknowledged by the band; so far it consists solely of quotes by Amby during performances of “The Grim Reaper.” It appears to have begun as a spontaneous freestyle during a performance; it is also possible that the lyrics were originally part of the shelved "KGLW rap album" project. The title was confirmed by Joey and Lucas during an [interview on Office Hours Live with Tim Heidecker](https://youtu.be/4koSNtnfRqw?t=3291). 
Covers
Open My Eyes
“Open My Eyes” is a short and simple garage rock song by Nazz. Written by Todd Rundgren, the track was a small success for the band and the only single from their 1968 [self-titled debut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazz_(album)). The song was later featured on the 1972 compilation *[Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965–1968](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuggets:_Original_Artyfacts_from_the_First_Psychedelic_Era,_1965%E2%80%931968)* which compiled a number of garage rock tracks from the mid to late ‘60s on a double album. This compilation would provide a building block for many bands, including King Gizzard. In a [Nardwuar interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENCswmcSALI), Eric said “I guess we all just started listening to Nuggets and everything. That’s how we started Gizzard. It’s just so easy to play. Makes you want to, like, pick up an instrument and have a bash and start a band. That’s rock and roll.” In 2012 Warner Music Australia released the cover compilation *[Nuggets: Antipodean Interpolations Of The First Psychedelic Era](https://kglw.net/discography/nuggets)*. The album sees a variety of Australian artists play their favorite garage rock songs from the compilation. On the album King Gizzard does a cover of “Open My Eyes” and transforms it into a fuzzed out and heavy psychedelic rock track with their iconic delay effects and growling vocals from Stu. On top of Gizzard’s involvement, the album also features The Murlocs doing “Psychotic Reaction” by The Count Five and has cover art by Jason Galea.

The song was played at least once by the band. The only known performance was on [2013-01-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-january-25-2013-paradiso-at-sydney-town-hall-eora-sydney-nsw-australia.html) at Paradiso at Sydney Town Hall in Eora (Sydney). This performance was for the release party for the *Nuggets* compilation.
Lean Woman Blues
“Lean Woman Blues” is a slow blues track on T.Rex’s 1971 album *[Electric Warrior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Warrior)*. It ends the first side of the record by reflecting on “lean love” — or love that causes trouble for its protagonist. The fuzzy guitars and charismatic vocals from Marc Bolan make it a standout on the album.  
King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard did their own take of it, with production similar to *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* (notably distinct similarities to [“I Am Not A Man Unless I Have A Woman”](https://kglw.net/song/im-not-a-man-unless-i-have-a-woman?artist_id=1) and [“God Is Calling Me Back Home”](https://kglw.net/song/god-is-calling-me-back-home?artist_id=1)). The history of the cover ties into the creation of *Float Along — Fill Your Lungs* as [Stu mentioned](https://soundcloud.com/moustachemagazine/interview-with-king-gizzard) that the band were listening to a bunch of T.Rex while recording the album. The cover was [credited on the band’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/cZZgzmNLzjbpMCmf/) to Stu and Syd O’Neil from the band [The Vasco Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vasco_Era), whom they mentioned was Stu’s neighbor at the time. Gizzard’s take on “Lean Woman Blues” was released on [August 14th, 2013](https://www.facebook.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/posts/download-our-cover-of-lean-woman-blues-xoxo/666702573342649/) as part of TripleR’s #Trex4Lyf radiothon. That same day it was also released to Soundcloud, though it is no longer available on the site. That said, it has been [reuploaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zxvigx0eFk) online.


No performances of “Lean Woman Blues” are known to exist.
Ghost
“Ghost” is attributed to [Goodnight Owl, later named Love Migrate](https://kglw.net/page/associated-music). Formed in Melbourne, the band consisted of six members including Joey and Eric as well as Casey Hartnett (who later worked with King Gizzard throughout 2017) as well as Joey’s sister Bella (who sings background vocals on [“Minimum Brain Size”](https://kglw.net/song/minimum-brain-size?artist_id=1)). The song is not readily available anywhere but King Gizzard played it early in their career. A composition of the same name which was written by Stu can be found on the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396566) though it's unclear if this is the same tune. We do know that Goodnight Owl was [playing with King Gizzard](https://x.com/goodnight_owl/status/9960711207784448?s=20) in late 2010 and that they had [begun to record a new (but unreleased) album]( https://x.com/goodnight_owl/status/55038798416982016?s=20) in the spring of 2011. The song may have been a collaboration between Stu and the band for the project, although this is unconfirmed. [Some have also theorized](https://www.reddit.com/r/KGATLW/comments/mtexvn/comment/gv0qza5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that the ASCAP track may be an early version of the b-side [“The Wholly Ghost”](https://kglw.net/song/the-wholly-ghost?artist_id=1) but there’s nothing to back this up outside of an easy shorthand as heard on [2014-05-07](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-7-2014-happy-dog-cleveland-oh-usa.html). 


The only known performance of “Ghost” was on [2011-02-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-12-2011-geelong-gaol-museum-geelong-vic-australia.html) at Geelong Gaol in Geelong for what was supposedly a Christmas function for Forte Magazine. They’re rendition starts slow before exploding into a loud garage rock jam that ends with the band returning to the soft dynamics of the intro.
I Wanna Be Your Dog
Released on their 1969 eponymous album, [“I Wanna Be Your Dog”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Wanna_Be_Your_Dog) is a punk rock song by The Stooges. Fuzzy guitars, sleigh bells and charismatic vocals make up the track with Iggy Pop slinging desperate, provocative lyrics. He [described it as a song about God](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/iggy-pop-origins-of-the-stooges-song-i-wanna-be-your-dog/) though he also commented on the song’s erotic elements. “Have you ever seen, like, a really good looking girl, really nicely dressed, and she’s walking down the street with her dog, right? And like her dog is… intimate with her body, and she likes him and everything. Basically, it’s the idea of I want to unite with your body. I don’t wanna talk about literature with you or judge you as a person. I wanna dog you.”


The first confirmed performance was on [2012-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2012-acdc-lane-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at AC/DC Lane in Naarm (Melbourne). In the following years it remained a rare track. Only one 2013 performance is known to exist ([2013-02-23](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-23-2013-corner-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). It would be played twice in 2014 with a final appearance on [2014-09-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-18-2014-ding-dong-lounge-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Ding Dong Lounge in Naarm (Melbourne). The song was played alongside [“Crookedile”](https://kglw.net/song/crookedile?artist_id=1) in 2012/2013 while the 2014 performances may have been standalone covers.
I Gotta Rock ‘n’ Roll
Add content warning just for the band name?


Taken from the 1998 album *[Teenage Hate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Hate)*, “I Gotta Rock ‘n’ Roll” is a distorted, lofi punk song by The Reatards. Inspired by ‘50s rock songs, the track is a fast and tight piece that clocks in at only a minute and sixteen seconds. In the early years of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, the band played the song in their sets.


The earliest reported performance of the song was on [2012-09-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-8-2012-the-national-hotel-geelong-vic-australia.html) at The National Hotel in Geelong. The first confirmed appearance, however, was on [2013-01-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-january-24-2013-corner-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at The Corner Hotel in Naarm (Melbourne) with the last known performance being on [2013-02-08](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-8-2013-pbs-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at PBS Studios in Naarm. Their cover of the song is faithful to the original but is typically longer only by a few seconds.
T.V. Eye
“T.V. Eye” is a loud and electrifying punk song that was released on The Stooges’ 1970 record *[Fun House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_House_(The_Stooges_album))*. While the name might lead one to believe that the song is commentating on television and popular culture, it’s actually about sexual desires. The phrase “T.V. eye”, coined by guitarist Ron Asheton’s sister Kathy, is an anagram which stands for [“twat vibe eye.”](https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/oct/14/the-stooges-10-of-the-best) To put it into context, if a man was staring at a woman he was interested in, one could say he’s “looking at her with his T.V. eye.” The song’s title would later be used as the title of an [Iggy Pop live album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Eye_Live_1977).    


Gizzard’s only known performance of the song was on [2014-11-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-20-2014-tivolivredenburg-pandora-utrecht-netherlands.html) at the TivoliVredenburg Pandora in Utrecht as part of the Le Guess Who? festival. No audio or video of this show is known to exist but the cover was confirmed in a [show review by 3voor12](https://3voor12.vpro.nl/artikelen/overzicht/2014/Le-Guess-Who-2014/LGW14--Austin-Psych-Fest-zorgt-voor-een-psychedelisch-hoogtepunt.html). 
Pushin’ Too Hard
“Pushin’ Too Hard” is a 1965 garage rock song by The Seeds. Founding member [Sky Saxon said](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/origins-the-seeds-pushin-too-hard/) the song was written in protest after the closing of one of his favorite clubs. “I wrote ‘Pushin’ Too Hard’ because they tore down Pandora’s Box on Sunset Boulevard. Everyone used to come there and drink coffee. People even used to bring their dogs. It was a groovy place for people to meet. Someone decided to tear it down, and it sits there today as a parking lot. The song was a reaction against the establishment for tearing down things they no longer consider works of art or what the people liked. It was a protest song.” While it initially failed to chart, the song found success after being reissued as well as being included on the compilation *[Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965–1968](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuggets:_Original_Artyfacts_from_the_First_Psychedelic_Era,_1965%E2%80%931968)*. This album proved to be a huge inspiration for King Gizzard. In a [Nardwuar interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENCswmcSALI), Eric said “I guess we all just started listening to Nuggets and everything. That’s how we started Gizzard. It’s just so easy to play. Makes you want to, like, pick up an instrument and have a bash and start a band. That’s rock and roll.” In that same interview, Narduwar gave Stu a 7” of the song which led to Stu talking about the track. “We covered this, I want to say once but maybe more than once. We jammed with The Babe Rainbow who are buddies of ours in Perth at the Mojos Bar, on this. That's the only time I remember doing this.” Lucas adds that they may have done it in a “uni band.” Stu explains that while the band forgets songs all of the time, they can’t forget this one because it's only two chords.


The only known performance was on [2014-12-14](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-december-14-2014-mojos-bar-fremantle-wa-australia.html) at the previously mentioned Mojo’s Bar in Fremantle alongside The Babe Rainbow. Their cover of the song is faster than The Seeds’ version.
On The Road Again
[“On The Road Again”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Road_Again_(Canned_Heat_song)) is a song by the band Canned Heat. Inspired by “Big Road Blues” by Tommy Johnson as well as “Dark Road” and “On The Road Again” by Floyd Jones, it was released on the 1968 album *[Boogie With Canned Heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boogie_with_Canned_Heat)* and became one of the band’s biggest hits. It’s a blues rock boogie vamping a simple one chord progression with psychedelic elements such as a tambura.


The only known performance of the song was on [2015-06-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-june-24-2015-babys-all-right-brooklyn-ny-usa.html) at Baby’s All Right in Brooklyn. This performance (briefly included in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=713s)*) was played with Ambrose on harmonica and Stu on guitar and vocals. In 2017 the band would walk on stage to [The Rockets’ version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxLMyG_2qJk) of the song from 1978. 
Silver Machine
Primarily recorded at The Roundhouse on February 13th, 1972 and released as a single later that year, “Silver Machine” is a heavy space rock song by the band Hawkwind. The lyrics were inspired by *[How To Construct A Time Machine by Alfred Jarry](https://www.patakosmos.com/database-open-access/Machine-time-jarry-en.pdf)* and invited listeners to join the band in their “silver machine,” presumably a time machine. The song was [written alongside NASA’s exploration of space](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/story-behind-the-song-hawkwind-silver-machine/) and was a response to the space-age consumerist dreams. Robert Calvert said “They’d put a man on the moon and were planning to put parking lots and hamburger stalls and everything up there. I thought that it was about time to come up with a song that actually sent this all up, which was ‘Silver Machine’. ‘Silver Machine’ was just to say, I’ve got a silver bicycle, and nobody got it. I didn’t think they would. I thought that what they would think we were singing about some sort of cosmic space travel machine. I did actually have a silver racing bike when I was a boy. I’ve got one now, in fact.” Looking back on this history, one could draw parallels between Hawkwind’s disillusionment with space colonization and Gizzard’s own weariness about the topic as heard on *[Infest the Rats’ Nest](https://kglw.net/discography/infest-the-rats-nest)* and *[PetroDragonic Apocalypse](https://kglw.net/discography/petrodragonic-apocalypse)*.  


Based on available data, “Silver Machine” was only played once by Gizzard on [2016-07-03](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-july-3-2016-mojos-bar-fremantle-australia.html) at Mojo’s Bar in Fremantle. Their cover was performed with the band ORB and is faithful to the single though it's longer by a minute.
All My Loving
Not to be mistaken with [The Beatles classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_My_Loving), “All My Loving” is a song by The Almighty Defenders which was released on their 2009 self-titled album. The band is a supergroup consisting of The Black Lips and The King Khan & BBQ Show. The track resembles ‘60s garage rock tracks and features call and response vocals in its choruses.


The only known performance was on [2017-06-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-19-2017-festsaal-kreuzberg-berlin-germany.html) at Festsaal Kreuzberg in Berlin. This version was played with King Khan as the final song of the show. The band’s cover is played close to the studio version.
Master of the Universe
“Master of the Universe” is a heavy space rock song that originally appeared on Hawkwind’s 1971 album *[In Search of Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Space)*. The lyrics describe a god at the center of the universe and are existential in nature. Hawkwind plays a chugging, sludgy rhythm with psychedelic instrumentation.


The song was teased throughout 2017 and 2018 in the *[Nonagon Infinity](https://kglw.net/discography/nonagon-infinity)* track [“Robot Stop”](https://kglw.net/song/robot-stop?artist_id=1), appearing briefly during Cavs’ hi-hat intro or towards the end of the break. This rendition didn’t last into 2019 as the jam was cut from the song entirely.
Let There Be Rock
[“Let There Be Rock”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_There_Be_Rock_(song)) is a hard rock song by AC/DC which was released on their [fourth album of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_There_Be_Rock) in 1977. Adapting a line from the Chuck Berry song “Roll Over Beethoven,” it details the creation of rock and roll and its rise to popularity. The band was influential on King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, with Stu [citing them](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/stu-mackenzie-king-gizzard-was-made-to-be-loose-we-didnt-have-a-rehearsal-for-years) as the reason he picked up guitar. "I guess, as a classic Australian, it was seeing videos of AC/DC playing live that made me think, ‘No, actually, guitar is cool!’ The music my dad liked, I like now, but it wasn’t electric guitars with loud, primal energy. It was Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Paul Kelly. So seeing AC/DC on TV made me say, ‘Please, Dad, can I have a guitar?!’”


The song was performed once on [2017-11-19](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-19-2017-great-northern-hotel-byron-bay-nsw-australia.html) at The Great Northern Hotel in Byron Bay for Gizzfest. Their cover was a tribute to AC/DC guitarist Malcolm Young who had passed away a day before at the age of 64. This version was sung by Ambrose who performed the song shirtless like Bon Scott would. The band [officially uploaded](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1785852794760949) a video of their cover to Facebook on November 21st.
Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap
[“Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Deeds_Done_Dirt_Cheap_(song)) is the title track from AC/DC’s [1976 album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Deeds_Done_Dirt_Cheap). The lyrics, [based on the character Dishonest John from the cartoon *Beany and Cecil](https://ultimateclassicrock.com/ac-dc-dirty-deeds-done-dirt-cheap-song/)*, are sung from the perspective of a hitman who advertises his speciality to anyone who needs it. AC/DC’s hard rock was massively influential on the band, especially Stu. He said to [Guitar World](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/stu-mackenzie-king-gizzard-was-made-to-be-loose-we-didnt-have-a-rehearsal-for-years) "I guess, as a classic Australian, it was seeing videos of AC/DC playing live that made me think, ‘No, actually, guitar is cool!’ The music my dad liked, I like now, but it wasn’t electric guitars with loud, primal energy. It was Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Paul Kelly. So seeing AC/DC on TV made me say, ‘Please, Dad, can I have a guitar?!’”


King Gizzard performed “Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap” live once on [2018-06-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-june-17-2018-brooklyn-steel-brooklyn-ny-usa.html) during their final night at the Brooklyn Steel in Brooklyn. The song was performed with Amyl and the Sniffers and at a faster pace than the original. The tempo seems to be taken from [Amyl’s version of the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlDOYENRI6w) played around the same time. No other performances by Gizzard are known to exist.
Proud Mary
[“Proud Mary”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proud_Mary) is a rock song released by the band Creedence Clearwater Revival on the 1969 album *[Bayou Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayou_Country_(album))*. The song is about someone who leaves a hard working but well paying job and boards a riverboat called the Proud Mary in search of a better life. John Fogerty (guitarist and songwriter for the band) [claimed](https://americansongwriter.com/fogerty-on-proud-mary/) that it was the first song he was ever proud of, even saying it was where his passion for songwriting began. “I especially remember writing ‘Proud Mary’ because I had never done it before. I had written songs, but they were always kind of ordinary. I was used to that, starting as about an eight-year old.  I’d go, ‘Hey! I made a song!’ But I’d always known it was not very good Until that wonderful afternoon when ‘Proud Mary’ happened. And I was just blown away. I was in shock, really. I thought, ‘Oh my God, this is really good!’”It proved to be one of the band’s biggest hits and was covered by a number of artists. In 1971, Ike and Tina Turner recorded the song for their album *[Workin’ Together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workin%27_Together)*. Moving away from the roots-inspiration of the original, they played with the dynamics of the track and created a high energy soul cover that ended up being its own hit.


King Gizzard (minus Lucas) performed the Ike and Tina Turner version of the song on [2019-03-16](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-march-16-2019-wedding-chapel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) for Lucas’ wedding reception. 
La Grange
Released on the 1973 album *[Tres Hombres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tres_Hombres)*, [“La Grange”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Grange_(song)) is a bluesy southern rock song by the band ZZ Top. The song borrows from the John Lee Hooker track [“Boogie Chillen,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4pp02_GN9A) so much so that it led to a [lawsuit](https://www.americanbluesscene.com/2012/11/blues-law-john-lee-hooker-v-zz-top/) in the ‘90s. Nevertheless, the song was the band’s first big hit and is still played on classic rock radio to this day.

[Paul Stanley said](https://americansongwriter.com/kiss-i-was-made-for-lovin-you-was-written-in-a-musical-whorehouse/) that he wrote it after visiting Studio 54 and hearing disco, thinking to himself that he could create his own take on the genre. The song was (and is) divisive for its unique and at the time hip sound with some fans arguing that they had sold out with the track. Gene Simmons [has also talked](https://www.nme.com/news/music/gene-simmons-hates-kiss-song-i-was-made-for-loving-you-2391435) about his distaste for the song in recent years.

(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party!)
[“You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (To Party!)”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(You_Gotta)_Fight_for_Your_Right_(To_Party!)) is a hard rock/punk inspired hip hop track by The Beastie Boys; which was released on the 1986 album *[Licensed To Ill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licensed_to_Ill)*. [Written in a matter of five minutes on table napkins](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/beastie-boys-hate-fight-for-your-right/), the song was meant to be a parody of party anthems of the time though was interpreted as a sincere defense. Mike D said “The only thing that upsets me is that we might have reinforced certain values of some people in our audience when our own values were actually totally different. There were tons of guys singing along to [“Fight for Your Right”] who were oblivious to the fact it was a total goof on them. Irony is often missed.” The Beastie Boys are one of Ambrose’s favorite bands.
