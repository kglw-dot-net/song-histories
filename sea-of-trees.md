# Sea of Trees

**This song contains subject matter that may not be suitable for all readers as it deals with the topic of self harm/suicide.** 

In the Yamanashi Prefecture of Japan, right next to Mount Fuji, is a thirty-kilometer-wide forest known as Aokigahara, or the “sea of trees.” Despite the forest’s scenic beauty, Aokigahara is infamous for the number of suicides that happen there. Specific numbers are hard to come by but [thousands have taken their lives](http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/03/19/suicide.forrest.japan/) there over the years with it becoming a notorious location referenced in films like *[The Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forest_(2016_American_film))*, as well as books such as *Nami no Tō (Tower of Waves)*, often reported as the novel that led to the trend. In 2012, the forest would become the topic of a short, emotional garage rock song by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard.

The title “Sea of Trees” was [originally conceived](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1622452830190862336?s=46&t=B6su2K8v-sosn58jPTf1Kw) as the band’s name. Stu recalled the story for [Mess+Noise](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295): “Just as King Gizzard was forming, Eric [Moore] went to a [Gareth] Liddiard show where he talked about ‘the Sea of Trees’ in Japan, a place where businessmen go to commit suicide. This actually ended up being our band name for a couple of our early shows and also seemed like a fitting title to this song.” In an [interview for SYN radio](https://soundcloud.com/monsebire/interview-with-joe-walker-king), Joey mentioned their old name while noting how “morbid” it was. He brings up a “haunting” [VICE documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FDSdg09df8) as a good watch. They abandoned the name due to it being [“a bit too dark”](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6pllv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and instead used it as a song title later on. Originally “Sea of Trees” may have been called [“Jam.”](https://kglw.net/song/jam) The band uploaded the song to the [Flightless Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/flightlessrecords/11-jam-1) on July 6th, 2012 with that title. Adding onto this, there’s an [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396573) entry listed sometime before the release of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)*, as well as a brief appearance on the setlist for [2012-05-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-9-2012-kings-cross-hotel-potts-point-nsw-australia.html). That said, it’s unclear if these meant an early “Sea of Trees” or something else entirely. Eventually the band decided to use the rejected band name as the song’s title, which appeared on the release of *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* on September 7th, 2012.  The song has a unique, haunting ending that cuts out quickly. According to the Mess+Noise article, it happened due to the band running out of tape. Interestingly, the lyrics to the verse have changed over time. Original pressings of *12 Bar Bruise*, as well as the 2023 reissues, have liner notes featuring a drawing of a tattooed man. On these, we see the original final line “and when you’re feeling suicidal, some times you just have to end it.” For the 2018 reissues, however, there were new liner notes. These replace the original line with “and when you’re feeling suicidal, sometimes you just have to unfold” — making it noticeably less dark. According to Joey before a performance of the song on [2022-10-11](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-11-2022-red-rocks-amphitheatre-morrison-co-usa.html), “Sea of Trees” is Lucas’s favorite Gizzard song.

If “Jam” is “Sea of Trees,” the first reported performance would be on [2012-05-09](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-9-2012-kings-cross-hotel-potts-point-nsw-australia.html) at the Kings Cross Hotel in Potts Point. However, if this is not the case, the earliest would be on [2012-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2012-acdc-lane-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) during the band’s Cherryfest performance. Setlist data for many of these early shows is hard to come by so it’s hard to see if it was ever that common, but we know that it appeared at least a few times from 2012 to 2014. A slowed-down performance from [2014-10-24](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-24-2014-brandeis-university-waltham-ma-usa-2.html) appears in the documentary *[BOOTLEG HOLIDAY FROM HELL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tTUOb7PR0w&t=1203s)*. The song would disappear after this gig, though it appeared briefly as teases in various others. After a long break, “Sea of Trees” reappeared on [2020-02-21](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-21-2020-croxton-park-hotel-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) during the band’s marathon show. Unlike previous versions, this performance is slightly longer at a bit over five minutes and features an improvised intro. Following this, “Sea of Trees” began to stretch to and above the ten-minute mark while also being paired with other songs like [“Trapdoor”](https://kglw.net/song/trapdoor) and [“Head On/Pill.”](https://kglw.net/song/head-on-pill) To further complicate the lyric issues, some performances of the song feature new lyrics such as [2022-05-20](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-may-20-2022-agora-cleveland-oh-usa.html), which replaces the words “end it”/”unfold” with “ignore it.” In a [Relix interview](https://relix.com/articles/detail/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-a-beautiful-mind-fuzz/) Stu mentioned that “Sea of Trees” is an easy song to bring on tour because it doesn’t require much rehearsal.
