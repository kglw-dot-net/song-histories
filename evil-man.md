# Evil Man

While Eyes Like The Sky lived and trained alongside the Yavapai-Apaches, the American Civil War had begun, though the fighting had not made it to Arizona. Yet one morning a group of Americans appeared, led by an “evil man” carrying a bible (later named The God Man). His group of soldiers attacked the Yavapai-Apache settlement in the name of their lord and killed most of them. While Miguel tried to run, he was struck on the head by the butt of a rifle and taken by the Americans after they noticed his blue eyes. As Broderick Smith puts it, “once more, a family he loved had been killed, this time, by Americans.” “Evil Man” starts ominously with distorted, echoing sounds before the introduction of a sinister guitar riff and groove featuring falsetto vocals from Ambrose and Stu. It was released on February 22nd, 2013 as the fifth song on *[Eyes Like The Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)*.
