# Life Is Cool

**This song contains subject matter that may not be suitable for all readers as it deals with the topic of self harm/suicide.**

King Gizzard releases a ton of songs, and with that volume of output comes many that will be neglected. Some may see a few appearances then fade away [“The Hungry Wolf of Fate”](https://kglw.net/song/the-hungry-wolf-of-fate), while others may never see time on stage to begin with [“Superposition”](https://kglw.net/song/superposition). Then you have the real oddities: covers of songs like [“Open My Eyes”](https://kglw.net/song/open-my-eyes) and material left as b-sides such as [“The Wholly Ghost”](https://kglw.net/song/the-wholly-ghost). A tier under this, however, are songs that for some reason have nothing to their name. Maybe a performance or two has been documented but as far as release history goes, they’re lost media. One of those songs was “Life Is Cool,” a fuzzy garage rock tune with a catchy riff and some gruesome lyrics. For years the track was lost, though it remained within the band’s circle with occasional mentions. It finally reappeared during the COVID-19 pandemic as the closer to the band’s official bootlegger compilation, *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)*, ending a ten year period of silence.

The story of “Life Is Cool” begins in 2010. A performance from [2010-10-29](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-29-2010-kaleide-theatre-rmit-university-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) at the Kaleide Theatre at RMIT University features the band playing the song with a slow groove. A month later on [2010-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2010-unknown-venue-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) the song was reportedly played again. [At some point in 2011](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/bootlegger) the studio version was recorded somewhere in Carlton at a faster pace than the previous renditions. This was [placed on a hard drive](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/teenage-gizzard) then never heard again. “Life Is Cool” was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396574) before the release of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* in 2013 and was referenced in a [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/fjdc1tbxBbrAMFaZ/) on October 29th, 2013. In September of 2014, the band created [LIFE IS COOL PTY LTD](https://abr.business.gov.au/ABN/View?abn=28602041663), a private limited company which the band controls to this day. The song was finally included as part of the compilation *Teenage Gizzard* which was released on Christmas Day, 2020.

The main vocal melody is very similar to the highly recognizable melody from the 2010 hit [“Chelsea Dagger”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Dagger) by The Fratellis. At the time, the band’s songwriting technique was [based heavily in mimicry](https://web.archive.org/web/20111129014623/http://www.triplejunearthed.com/Artists/FeaturedArtist.aspx?artistid=41113): “Just waiting for the new Oh Sees record to come out so we can try and write some more songs.” This one was a prime candidate for their house party vibe at the time.
