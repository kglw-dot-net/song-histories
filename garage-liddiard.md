# Garage Liddiard

Gareth Liddiard is an Australian musician known for his work in The Drones and Tropical Fuck Storm, as well as his own solo career. King Gizzard would [tour with The Drones in 2013](https://themusic.com.au/reviews/the-drones-the-tivoli-nick-wright/evhtbG9ukZA/16-04-13) and work with Gareth on *[Fishing For Fishies](https://kglw.net/discography/fishing-for-fishies)*. Portions of these sessions were used on the Tropical Fuck Storm collaborative EP *[Satanic Slumber Party](https://kglw.net/discography/satanic-slumber-party)* and served to inspire the *[Omnium Gatherum](https://kglw.net/discography/omnium-gatherum)* classic, [“The Dripping Tap.”](https://kglw.net/song/the-dripping-tap?artist_id=1) Yet before any of that, he was given a nod with the short garage rock song “Garage Liddiard.”

It originally started out as a [“Twist and Shout”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twist_and_Shout)-like song according to a [Mess+Noise track-by-track breakdown](https://web.archive.org/web/20130203100826/http://messandnoise.com/articles/4514295), but was changed when producer Paul Maybury told them a faster version could be more interesting. Stu said during an [interview for FBI Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azuedaRzLzs) that the title was essentially meaningless. “It’s not meant to be anything super smart, or like, super witty or anything. It’s just a bit of a play on words…” Eric chimes in saying “Joe, our guitarist, just said it one day and we thought it was hilarious… but we are massive fans of Gaza and The Drones so it’s definitely not a dig in any way. It’s more of an ode.” When asked if Gareth had heard the song, Eric said that he thinks he hasn’t heard it but knows of it. In another [interview for Beat](https://web.archive.org/web/20140309074555/http://www.beat.com.au/music/king-gizzard-lizard-wizard) Eric said “I think with ‘Garage Liddiard’ we just needed a title and Joe was saying all this funny stuff then came up with that. It’s a garage-y song and we all love The Drones. But at the same time, it’s kind of what Gizzard is – that simple, Aussie fun.”  It was released on *[12 Bar Bruise](https://kglw.net/discography/12-bar-bruise)* on September 7th, 2012.

Based on available setlist data, “Garage Liddiard” has never been played live.
