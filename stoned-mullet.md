# Stoned Mullet

“Stoned Mullet” is a simple and immature three-chord garage rock song about getting stoned and masturbating. Stu even burps at the end of the track — hard to make it more crude than that. The title was taken from a band at Stu's High School. Introducing the song during a performance at PBS studios on [2011-10-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-17-2011-pbs-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html), Stu explained: “when I was in high school there was a band called Stoned Mullet and I thought that was really cool.”  

The title is a play on the Australian phrase “like a stunned mullet,” meaning to be dazed or stupefied.

A demo for “Stoned Mullet” was released on *[Demos Vol. 3: Music To Eat Pond Scum To](https://kglw.net/discography/demos-vol-3)*. This version is not far from the final version and was recorded by Stu with vocals, electric guitar, bass, and a drum machine. Interestingly, the bass slide heard at the end of the demo appears at the beginning of [“Footy Footy”](https://kglw.net/song/footy-footy)’s demo, indicating that both were written at about the same time. Before the release of *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach)*, the song was [introduced as “Jack-It”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8TTZeCSck4) live. A month before the release of the EP, the song appeared on the second Deaf Ambitions mixtape *[Deaf Ambitions Mixtape: Coast To Coast](https://kglw.net/discography/deaf-ambitions-mixtape-coast-to-coast)*. Here it was [listed](https://web.archive.org/web/20120109171519/https://deafambitions.blogspot.com/2011/09/deaf-ambitions-mixtape-coast-to-coast.html) as exclusive to the tape with the title “Jack-It and Green Out.” It’s unclear if this was the demo or the full studio version as the tape is no longer available.  “Stoned Mullet”, with its official title, was released on October 21st, 2011.

Aside from the above PBS performance, we only know of one other instance of the song being played live. This was at the High Noon Festival at the Northcote Social Club in Naarm (Melbourne) on [2011-09-18](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-september-18-2011-northcote-social-club-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html).
