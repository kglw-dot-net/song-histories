# Sleep

Opening the band’s second single, “Sleep” is about waking up next to someone who doesn’t want you to leave. Drenched in muffled, delayed guitars, the song evokes a dreamlike, sleepy feeling. It’s the first song in the band’s discography to mention sleeping, a common topic which would reappear on songs like [“Sleep Drifter,”](https://kglw.net/song/sleep-drifter) [“I’m Sleepin’ In”](https://kglw.net/song/im-sleepin-in) and [“Sleepwalker.”](https://kglw.net/song/sleepwalker) 


[First posted](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/W7n3JmkftJSzSRQE/) on November 25th, 2010, the [single for “Sleep”](https://kglw.net/discography/sleepsummer-single) was released as a CD sometime that same year with a fold-out sleeve depicting King Gizzard and a Lizard Wizard. While it was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396581) sometime before the release of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)*, the band refused to release it. In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu explained that the CDs were made for friends and that he was unsure what happened to them. He [also said](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that, at the time, he had no intentions on re-releasing the singles. In a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6r4lt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the band were asked multiple times to release the early material as part of a compilation. On December 14th, they [tweeted](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1338441959728246785?s=46&t=BsPWJiwij5zesoKn4EojGA) that they were looking for high quality FLACs of the first two singles. This would be for *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)*, released on Christmas Day. The compilation contains “Sleep” as the third song.

No performances of “Sleep” are known to exist.
