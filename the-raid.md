# The Raid

Proceeding directly after the events of [“Year Of Our Lord”](https://kglw.net/song/year-of-our-lord); “The Raid” tells of the Yavapai-Apache men who kill the adults in the farmstead after gaining word from the watcher. They take only the weapons and the children, so that the Yavapai-Apache people can raise them as their own to help during the Yavapai Wars. In the attack, they take a five year old Miguel O’Brien. Soundtracking the attack is a rowdy, triplet-filled spaghetti western instrumental with reverb crackling (most likely a Danelectro Spring Pedal used to similar effect on [“Hot Wax”](https://kglw.net/song/hot-wax)) and the sounds of metal clanging. According to a [Happy Magazine](https://happymag.tv/eyes-like-the-sky/) article with Broderick Smith, Miguel O’Brien’s kidnapping was based on [Comanche raids](https://www.npr.org/2011/05/20/136438816/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-comanche-empire) in the 1800s. “I based [the story] on that and that’s what they wanted.” The song is a springy rock track with notable tremolo picking, upbeat drums, and a variety of sound effects. It was released on February 22nd, 2013.
