# Hey There

“Hey There” is a fitting opener for King Gizzard’s debut single. Featuring a set of simplistic lyrics about loving someone (and their hair) and a groovy garage rock composition, it kicks off the band’s career with a bang.

In the band’s [first ever Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=169305639752159&id=168329496513295&rdid=35zeaRbj66EC5KAy) on October 19th, 2010, they posted a link to “Hey There” which was hosted on SoundCloud. A CD single for *[Hey There/Ants and Bats](https://kglw.net/discography/hey-thereants)* was released in 2010 with a fold-out sleeve depicting King Gizzard and a Lizard Wizard. Outside of this, the band refused to release the song officially though they had added it to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396569). In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu explained that the CDs were made for friends and that he was unsure what happened to them. He [also said](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that, at the time, he had no intentions on re-releasing the singles. For years the single was circulated unofficially. On December 14th, 2020, the band [tweeted](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1338441959728246785?s=46&t=BsPWJiwij5zesoKn4EojGA) that they were looking for high quality FLACs of the first two singles. This would be for *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)*, released on Christmas Day.

“Hey There” was reportedly played on [2010-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2010-unknown-venue-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html). No other performances are known.
