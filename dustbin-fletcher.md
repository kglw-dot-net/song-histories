# Dustbin Fletcher

During the band’s performance on [2011-10-17](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-october-17-2011-pbs-studios-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html"), Joey said “this next song is called ‘Dustbin Fletcher’, named after our favorite Essendon veteran.” That player is [Dustin Fletcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Fletcher), a footy player who played for [Essendon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essendon_Football_Club) from 1993 to 2015. While the song that follows has nothing to do with Fletcher’s career and focuses instead on feeling happy and good, “Dustbin Fletcher” is the first mention of footy in the band’s discography — later expanded upon with [“Footy Footy.”](https://kglw.net/song/footy-footy) It was released as the seventh song on *[Willoughby’s Beach](https://kglw.net/discography/willoughbys-beach")* on October 21st, 2011.
