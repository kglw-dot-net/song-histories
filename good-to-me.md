The song was first [posted about](https://www.facebook.com/100044289166773/posts/180642511957427/?rdid=tmSigkP7MFRPGYNo) on January 3rd, 2011 and said to part of their upcoming EP *With Their Happy Magic Merry Band*, which would end up becoming *Anglesea*. The EP was originally released as a [limited run of CDs]("https://www.discogs.com/release/4050315-King-Gizzard-And-The-Lizard-Wizard-Anglesea/image/SW1hZ2U6Nzk0MTgwOA==), and was never considered a ‘real’ release by the band. The song was added to the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396567) before the release of *[Float Along — Fill Your Lungs](https://kglw.net/discography/float-along-fill-your-lungs)* in 2013 but wasn’t made widely available. In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu said that *Anglesea* and the early singles were released on CD for friends and that he didn’t know what happened to them, while [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) stated there were no plans to release the songs anytime soon. After a number of requests during a [2020 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/k43r6p/comment/ge6r4lt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), the band released *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)* on Christmas Day. “Good To Me” was the seventh track.

We only know of a few shows where “Good To Me” was played. The first reported performance was on [2010-11-25](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-november-25-2010-unknown-venue-naarm-melbourne-vic-australia.html) during the “Sleep/Summer!” release party. The first confirmed performance was on [2011-02-12](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-february-12-2011-geelong-gaol-museum-geelong-vic-australia.html) at the Geelong Gaol in Geelong, while the other happened on [2011-03-04](https://kglw.net/setlists/king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-march-4-2011-the-grace-darling-hotel-naarm-melbourne-australia.html) at the National Hotel in Geelong for *Anglesea* release party. Live versions of the song feature an extended intro with Stu singing the lyrics syncopated with his guitar, the band joining him to embellish the final notes. He also sings the verses in a crazier way, bringing different inflections than heard on the *Anglesea* version.
