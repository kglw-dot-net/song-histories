# Eyes Like The Sky

With spaghetti western guitars and cracking gunfire, the title track of *[Eyes Like The Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)* acts as a prologue that sets up the narrated story of the album, which is named after its protagonist. Taking place in the southwest United States before and after the American Civil War, the lands are filled with bloodshed and fighting over territory and belief. Out of that turmoil rises a figure who makes a number of names for himself through violence. *Eyes Like The Sky* is his story.

The music starts with a slow build before moving into an epic riff, backed by two powerful hits by the band. The song itself opens with a distorted lead line that conveys the vast frontier of the story.  It was first revealed on January 6th, 2013 as part of the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYrUQAlaQOw) for the album and was released properly on February 22nd, 2013.
