# Ants and Bats

With a descending chromatic bass line similar to Pink Floyd’s 1973 hit [“Money,”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_(Pink_Floyd_song)) explosive choruses and simple, disconnected lyrics, “Ants and Bats” is a powerful b-side for the band’s debut single.

The song was [first mentioned](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/rNzjxt7WPbvSAMLv/) on October 22nd, 2010 with a link to the song on their Facebook page. A CD single for *[Hey There/Ants and Bats](https://kglw.net/discography/hey-thereants)* was released in 2010 with a fold-out sleeve depicting King Gizzard and a Lizard Wizard. Outside of this, the band refused to release the song officially though they had registered it in the [ASCAP ACE Repertory](https://www.ascap.com/repertory#/ace/search/workID/885396562). In a [2015 Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmavdf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), Stu explained that the CDs were made for friends and that he was unsure what happened to them. He [also said](https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/3vcjjx/comment/cxmb3ul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that, at the time, he had no intentions on re-releasing the singles. For years the single was circulated unofficially. On December 14th, 2020, the band [tweeted](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1338441959728246785?s=46&t=BsPWJiwij5zesoKn4EojGA) that they were looking for high quality FLACs of the first two singles. This would be for *[Teenage Gizzard](https://kglw.net/discography/teenage-gizzard)*, released on Christmas Day. The second song on the album would be “Ants and Bats.”
