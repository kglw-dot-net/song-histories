# The Killing Ground

Chapter five follows Blue and the Yavapai girl as they escape Fort Whipple. The two exchange names and ride until the horses can't run anymore. From there they walk across Arizona towards Apache territory, hearing the sound of gunfire and horses in the distance, and seeing clouds of dust fly into the air. The following day they discover what has happened. A group of Americans, all dead on the ground. The details of the scene are inconsistent with the tactics of Native Americans,—the white men had staged a raid. They took what they could and began running once more. According to Stu’s [liner notes](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/release/eyes-like-the-sky) for the album’s 2018 reissue, this was one of the first songs recorded for *[Eyes Like The Sky](https://kglw.net/discography/eyes-like-the-sky)*. It was performed by Cavs, Lucas, and Stu in his parent’s garage in Anglesea. The recording location is evident in the final take as the sound of Stu’s father is heard banging a rusted saw blade alongside the sounds of the family dogs. “The Killing Ground” is the calmest track on *Eyes Like The Sky* with strummed acoustic guitar and whistling, though the sinister guitar work gives the music a sense of unease. It was released on February 22nd, 2013.

“The Killing Ground” has never been played live.
